1007	Author and religious scholar Reza Aslan is one of those people who's at NPR West so often that he blurs the line between guest and employee. We always joke with our regulars that they should have a punch card, and when it's full, they get their own cubicle. Recently, Aslan has been in and out of our studios a lot to talk about his new book, a biography called Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth. Aslan's focus for this biography was of Jesus Christ, the man. "Whatever else he was, whether he was the messiah, or God, or what have you, he was a man. He was a human being," Aslan told Weekend Edition Sunday Host Rachel Martin. For the book, Aslan took the details that are known about the time of Jesus, first century Palestine, a time period that was well documented by the Romans and filled in the details of his life from the sacred history of the Gospels. "But I also recognize as a historian that this is sacred history. ... They are valuable in the sense that they reveal certain truths to us, but that the facts that they reveal are not as valuable as the truths are." To hear more about Aslan's history of Jesus of Nazareth, you can listen to the Weekend Edition Sunday interview: Or a deeper dive on Fresh Air: While it's a no-brainer to us NPR West-ers that Aslan 'hearts' NPR, and while I've had any number of opportunities to ask him to pose for us, it was on this particular day that he was dressed for the occasion.

1007	History repeats itself in Britain: Another piece of art by the mysterious graffiti artist Banksy has been cut out of a wall in the London Borough of Haringey and is expected to fetch hundreds of thousands at an auction. As The Independent reports, the last time, the Sincura Group sold a piece of art called Slave Labour for 750,000 pounds. But that was not without controversy. As we reported, the auction touched off an uproar with Banksy and the community complaining that the art work should stay where it was painted. What's more, it was a mystery how the auction house had acquired the art work: Was it the artist or owner of the building that was benefiting? This time around, reports the Haringey Independent, the auction house says the proceeds will go to charity. The art work in question is features two kids looking up a sign that reads "No Ball Games." The paper reports that, again, residents are not happy: "Taslima Khatoon, of the Tottenham Art Group, said that while it is sad that mural has been taken, at least the money will be going to a good cause. "She said: 'Street art is there for the community to appreciate, enjoy and look after. "'I know the community is very upset and the situation with the Wood Green Banksy will only make this worse. "'The only positive thing we can take away is that the money will go towards a good cause.'" The BBC has more from the auction house: "The group's director Tony Baxter said he had been approached and asked if he could manage the sale of No Ball Games. "He declined to say who approached him. He said the piece, one of Banksy's largest, had to be removed in three pieces. "The last section featuring a girl will be removed later, he said."  [Copyright 2013 NPR]

1007	Last week, a group of young people who'd been deported to Mexico made a big show of their ultimately futile attempt to re-enter the United States. They were pushing for legislation nicknamed the DREAM Act, which would grant a pathway to citizenship for undocumented young people who were brought to the United States when they were very young. But Steve King, a longtime Republican representative from Iowa and an outspoken opponent of immigration reform, wasn't having it. They will say to me and others who defend the rule of law, 'We have to do something about the 11 million. Some of them are valedictorians.' Well, my answer to that is ... it's true in some cases, but they weren't all valedictorians, they weren't all brought in by their parents. For everyone who's a valedictorian, there's another hundred out there, they weigh 130 pounds and they've got calves the size of cantaloupes because they're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert. Those people would be legalized with the same act. As you might have guessed, that didn't really go over too well. John Boehner, the speaker of the House, rebuked his fellow Republican's comments. "There's no place in this debate for hateful or ignorant comments from elected officials," Boehner said earlier this week. Some young immigrant advocates delivered bags full of cantaloupes in front of King's office in mocking protest. Even Raul Labrador, an Idaho representative who's a conservative's conservative, blasted King this week, calling his comments "reprehensible" and referring to King as a "wing nut." (No statement from the NFL yet, but presumably, scouts are salivating over this new crop of freakishly muscled running back prospects pouring over the border.) As my colleague Frank James wrote, King's comments come at an inconvenient time for Republicans, who were badly beaten by Democrats among Latino voters in last fall's elections even as Latinos become an increasingly significant part of the electorate. (According to polls, immigration matters less to Latino voters than the economy and education, but many people see immigration as a kind of litmus test for the way a candidate feels about Latinos.) The party had been trying to repair that breach before King's, er, impolitic comments. But where other politicians might walk back comments like this, King only doubled down. "Eighty [percent] to 90 percent of the illegal drugs consumed in America come from or through Mexico," he said the next day. "I can tell you that in Mexico they are recruiting kids to be drug smugglers, between the ages of 11 and 18." And in the grand Washington tradition, King's re-election campaign sent out an email to supporters referencing the hullabaloo and asking for donations to fight "the pro-amnesty crowd [that's] out in full force against me." The email went on: The left will use these made up headlines in TV and radio commercials to influence the voters of Iowa's 4th District to vote against me. Without my own war chest, I won't be able to defend myself and set the record straight with Iowans. Can I count on you to contribute $25, $50, $100 or more to my campaign to help fend off these attacks? If every one of you who receive this email were to just give $15 today, we would raise enough money to pay for television ads on every Des Moines network station for this entire election cycle – and the left will be hard pressed to fight back. Say what you will about the guy and his history of, er, impolitic comments — that Hillary Clinton has close ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, calling for Muslims to be racially profiled at airports, seemingly comparing immigrants to dogs on Univision — he's more than willing to own what he says. King is hardly the first politician to make racially inflammatory statements. And there's an argument to be made that King's comments have some value; there are countless Americans who agree with King, and having his ideas in a public space gives the country an opportunity to grapple with them. (Conversely, granting legitimacy to comments like King's expands the universe of acceptable discourse.) But the current media environment means that someone like King, a relative backbencher, can get airtime and attention that far outstrips his actual political influence. That means King has a smaller margin of error from ignominy — he can't make public statements anywhere that won't end up on YouTube or tweeted out to the wider world. And given the challenge the GOP faces in winning Latino converts, his party has a smaller margin for error, too. [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
1007	Barnaby Jack, one of the world's most prominent hackers, died on Friday, the San Francisco Medical Examiner tells NPR's Steve Henn. As Steve tells our Newscast unit, Jack became a hacker hero when he exploited a security vulnerability in an ATM machine and made it spit out cash. The move became known as "Jackpotting." Via YouTube, here is the moment from the Black Hat USA 2010 conference (the real action starts at 3:05 and 5:57): Jack was 36. As Bloomberg reports, Jack did not stop at ATMs. Last year, he found a security flaw in an insulin pump that allowed him to send a command from 300 feet away that would deliver a deathly dose. Next week, Jack planned to show off his latest hack at the Blackhat conference: He was going to show how he could hack into a pacemaker or defibrillator and short it out, presumably killing a person. Jack told Vice Magazine that he was intrigued by the devices when he found out they were capable of communicating wirelessly. "I decided to look at pacemakers and ICDs (implantable cardioverter defibrillators) to see if they communicated securely and if it would be possible for an attacker to remotely control these devices," he said. After about six months, he found a vulnerability and was able to control the device. Steve Henn reminds us that Jack was one of the good guys. He found the vulnerabilities and told manufacturers about them. Jack worked at the security firm IOActive. "Lost but never forgotten our beloved pirate, Barnaby Jack has passed," IO said on Twitter. "He was a master hacker and dear friend. Here's to you Barnes!" His cause of death is still unknown. [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
1007	Don't try to pretend your gibes and judgments of the overweight people in your life are for their own good. Florida researchers have evidence that discriminating against fat people only makes them fatter. "People often rationalize that it's OK to discriminate based on weight because it will motivate the victim to lose pounds," Angelina Sutin, a psychologist at the Florida State College of Medicine in Tallahassee, tells Shots. "But our findings suggest the opposite." Sutin and a colleague checked survey data from more than 6,000 American men and women age 50 and older who were asked how often in their daily lives they experienced different types of discrimination. Examples ranged from discourtesy or refusal of restaurant service to not getting a job or promotion. The survey then asked the respondents why they thought the discrimination happened. Was it was because of their race or age, for example, or their sex, age or weight? Researchers also measured the participants' weight and height. Four years later, a follow-up survey asked the same questions and checked for changes in weight. Overweight people who said they'd experienced discrimination based on weight were more than twice as likely to be obese four years later than people who didn't mention such discrimination. And those who started out obese were three times more likely to remain so if they'd been harshly targeted because of their weight. Other types of discrimination showed no effect on weight. Sutin's study, published in the latest issue of the online journal PLOS One, wasn't designed to get at why weight discrimination led many fat people to pack on even more pounds. But other research suggests that increased rates of depression, emotional eating and low-self esteem likely play a role. So does increased stress (and the associated hormonal surges that can trigger even more hunger and eating), as well as the avoidance of exercise. "If someone's mean to you at the gym because of your weight or acts like you don't belong there," Sutin says, "you're less likely to go back." The roots of obesity are complex and include genetics and other factors that go well beyond individual choice. "Trying to promote healthy behaviors is a good thing," she says, but shaming someone has no place in the solution. Unfortunately, weight-related prejudice and discrimination persists in many spheres and is only increasing among employers, teachers — and doctors. [Copyright 2013 NPR]

1007	Based in Nashville via Los Angeles, the husband and wife duo of Amanda Sudano and Abner Ramirez have been performing together for nearly a decade as Johnnyswim. Now they make their first appearance on Mountain Stage, recorded live on the campus of West Virginia University in Morgantown. Ramirez studied music at Douglas Anderson School of the Arts in his native Florida, while Sudano spent much of her young life touring the world as a backing singer for her mother, the late disco queen Donna Summer. Their 2012 album Home, Vol. 1, an amalgam of soul, folk, pop and blues, has been compared to work by superstars like Lauryn Hill and John Mayer.

1007	Anthony Weiner and Eliot Spitzer have been very good to the New York tabloids. First, they delivered lurid scandals for cheeky newspaper headline writers to work with. That's like rocket fuel for the tabs, which thrive on conflict and scandal and aren't nearly as cautious and measured as the broadsheets. Then, after resigning from office — Weiner from Congress, Spitzer from the governorship — each decided to make an against-all-odds return to elected politics this year. On Tuesday, the pun-loving tabs got even luckier: Weiner admitted that his lewd message exchanges with other women — the behavior that led to his 2011 resignation from the House — had, in fact, continued more than a year after his initial confession. Here's a quick recap of the rough treatment Weiner and Spitzer have received, courtesy of two of the best-known tabloids, the New York Daily News and the New York Post: In the beginning, there was Spitzer. The ex-governor resigned in March 2008 after The New York Times reported that Spitzer had been a client of an escort service. The day after the revelation, the tabs were off and running. Three years later, it was Weiner who got embroiled in a sensational sex scandal. Naturally, given his unique surname, the puns were over the top — and gleefully juvenile. Weiner initially sought to hold on to his job, even after more women came forward. The Post wasn't helping his cause: It tagged any content related to the scandal as "Battle of the Bulge," signaling the paper's snickering approach. Weiner's return to the arena in April, when he began hinting at a run for mayor, only revved up the sexually suggestive headlines. As if that wasn't enough, more manna from heaven: Earlier this month, the disgraced Spitzer suddenly announced a run for New York City comptroller, giving the tabs another chance to pile on. Then came the latest revelations in the Weiner scandal: more sexting than the ex-congressman had previously acknowledged, followed by a dramatic press conference. The ex-congressman's porn star-like online nickname — Carlos Danger — proved irresistible. The tabs' fun won't end there. The Democratic primary for both offices isn't until Sept. 10.

1007	The world has changed a lot since a divorced mother of two teamed up with a St. Louis gynecologist to study the physiology of sex. Masters and Johnson's first book, Human Sexual Response, made Virginia Johnson and William Masters household names in the 1960s. More than any other scientists before them, they approached sex as a biological process to be observed, measured and analyzed. Virginia Masters died this week at age 88. Her work is credited with dispelling many long-held myths about sex, from the thought that penis size matters to the notion that old people don't do it. "We've gone through tremendous change," says Eli Coleman, director of the program in human sexuality at the University of Minnesota. He says he remembers when Masters and Johnson couldn't get their work published in medical journals. "That just isn't the case any more," Coleman told Shots. "Masters and Johnson were pioneers, and they legitimized the field. We're seeing the results of their courage and labor." But research on sex can still be a tough sell, even in an age when Internet porn has made it possible for people to view every imaginable form of sexual conduct. Research projects that have the word "sex" somewhere in them continue to run into trouble with critics in Congress and advocacy groups. They include a project at the University of Minnesota funded by the National Institutes of Health that was designed to reduce the risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases for homosexual men who looked for sexual partners on the Internet. The Traditional Values Coalition called that a "government-funded gay porn site." "Did you know that your paycheck was hit in order to fund a study on how to use condoms correctly?" Fox News pundit Sean Hannity asked this spring. He was talking about a $423,500 study at the Indiana University's Kinsey Institute for Sex, Gender, and Reproduction on barriers to condom use. Hannity claimed the project, which got federal stimulus funding, failed to create jobs. The university says that in fact about nine researchers were employed for three years, and the research is studying how to increase proper condom use to reduce STDs and pregnancy. "Sex is still a very volatile subject," says Jennifer Bass, director of communications for the Kinsey Institute. "The questions we had 50 years ago are different, but some of those questions still remain. Why do people do what they do even though they know about the consequences? Why do smart people get involved in dangerous situations? How does sex influence people's lives and choices?" With the NIH research budget shrinking, scientists who study sex will find the hunt for funds no easier. "But I think there is a lot of support of basic science research in the area of sexuality," Coleman says — at least from other scientists. [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
1007	Hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors has pleaded not guilty to wire and securities fraud, a day after federal prosecutors in New York charged the firm in connection with an alleged insider trading scheme. Peter Nussbaum, SAC's general counsel, entered the plea on behalf of the firm, one of Wall Street's biggest hedge funds. Assistant U.S. Attorney Antonia Apps told a federal judge in Manhattan that "voluminous" evidence, including "electronic messages, instant messages, court-ordered wiretaps and consensual recordings" existed to prove that SAC Capital knowingly participated in insider trading over a 10-year period. SAC's owner, billionaire Steven Cohen, is already the subject of a civil case by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to two portfolio managers, Mathew Martoma and Michael Steinberg, who prosecutors say were allowed to execute trades based on insider knowledge. As NPR's Elise Hu reported Thursday, Cohen says he didn't see a key, incriminating email because he gets too many messages. The firm issued a statement earlier this week saying it "has never encouraged, promoted or tolerated insider trading and takes its compliance and management obligations seriously." In March, SAC affiliates agreed to pay more than $600 million in penalties related to charges that they participated in an insider trading scheme involving a clinical trial for a new Alzheimer's drug.

1007	Maybe the Democrat who hopes to unseat Sen. Mitch McConnell is ready for prime time after all. That's one way to view the highly polished Web video in which Alison Lundergan Grimes, Kentucky's secretary of state, appears, employing humor, pathos, earnestness and her grandmothers to skewer the leader of the Senate Republicans. The ad cleverly throws down the gauntlet to McConnell's campaign, which in a somewhat unusual video of a few weeks ago had an AutoTuned singer ask and answer the question: "What rhymes with Alison Lundergan Grimes? Not ready for prime time." (Spoiler alert: Grimes' ad asks the question: What rhymes with Mitch?" And the way it gets there is worth the journey.) The new Grimes video, which announces that she will have a grand rollout of her campaign on Tuesday, is something of a do-over after a very rough entry into the race in early July. When Grimes announced a few weeks ago that she would make the U.S. Senate race against McConnell, his campaign — and neutral observers — generally observed that her candidacy seemed prematurely born, to say the least. There was a slapdash quality to her launch, whether it was the banner from her secretary of state campaign as a backdrop or a website that essentially was a watch-this-space placeholder. For a campaign striving to be taken seriously as a threat to a canny and formidable incumbent like McConnell, it was an unorthodox approach, to put it mildly. It seemed to give credence to the McConnell campaign's contention that she wasn't ready for the national political stage and certainly not ready to contend with the likes of a five-term senator. But if the video is any indication of what's to come, and if McConnell can get past a primary bid from Matt Bevin, a Tea Party-oriented challenger, the general election campaign could turn out to look a lot less like a contest between the University of Louisville and, say, Transylvania University basketball teams than a race where the challenger has a real chance at an upset. McConnell, a shrewd political veteran with great money-raising chops, still holds a substantial edge. A recent survey by Wenzel Strategies, a Republican pollster, showed the senator with substantial leads over Grimes and Bevin. McConnell held about an 8-percentage-point lead over Grimes and a nearly 40-point lead over Bevin.  [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
1007	The voting is finished. The taste test is done. The verdict is in: Marti Olesen has won All Things Considered's Taste of Summer contest with her recipe for Diane's Dad's Summer Sandwich. I know not everybody will agree with my decision. Frankly, in my book, all three finalists are winners. Judging them was tricky business because so often it was like comparing apples, oranges and kumquats. Each story had its own merits. Each recipe was good and had its vocal supporters. Susan Jones' Strawberry Trifle story was charming and fantastic. That a non-cook's "bring a dish" anxiety was extinguished by serendipity, when a scrap of paper blowing in the wind on recycling day caught her attention, is appealing for anyone who's struggled in the kitchen. Patricia Mulvey's story was about how her Ensenada Slaw came out of a crazy trip from hell to Mexico. I think "Maximo's Auto Repair and Beauty Supply Shop" will be burned in my brain for the rest of my life. Screwball comedy — when it happens off-screen — is also very, very appealing, and Pat is an expressive storyteller, for sure. But Marti Olesen's story was stealthy. On the surface, it was simple: She hears about a recipe with ingredients that seem odd together, she tries it, she doesn't like it. But then she learns the secret: It's in the layering. She tries it again and loves it so much she plants a garden to better enjoy this summer sandwich. Her dedication to this thing that didn't seem like it would taste all that good is also appealing. At our NPR headquarters, I made each recipe for a Taste of Summer taste test. They were all easy to do, included seasonal ingredients and earned a summer cook's vote of gratitude for not requiring an oven or a stove top. But here's one thing that gave the summer sandwich an edge: It has high shareability, in that it's a recipe people really, really want to share. Over and over, pro-sandwich listeners wrote in along these lines: "I couldn't believe this sandwich, with its white cheddar cheese, tomato, cucumber, onion and crunchy peanut butter combo, could possibly be that good. So I made it. I loved it. I loved it so much I made another. I made my kids try it. They loved it. I cannot wait to make it again." This high shareability quotient was driven home during our taste test. While not everybody sampling was Team Sandwich, everybody who was Team Sandwich was emphatically and surprisingly Team Sandwich, and their enthusiasm was infectious. You could practically hear the buzz around the table as people not involved with the taste test were pulled in to try the sandwich. As engineer Stu Rushfield, who'd heard all the Taste of Summer stories, put it: "I wouldn't say no to any of these recipes. But the one I'd make again is the sandwich. Because it's just so strange. And so good." Thanks to everyone who participated in our contest. It was a lot of fun. I'm off to make another sandwich now. The crunchy peanut butter really does make it. Melissa Gray is the producer of All Things Considered's Found Recipes series. [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
1007	In the latest in a string of insider trading cases, federal prosecutors this week indicted SAC Capital, one of the most prominent and profitable hedge funds in the world. But when it comes to the 2008 financial crisis that sent the economy into a tailspin, criminal prosecutions have been few and far between. "The folks responsible for this incredibly painful economic damage that struck our economy have gone free," says Neil Barofsky, a former federal prosecutor who also served as special inspector general overseeing the big Troubled Asset Relief Program bank bailout, signed into law by President Bush in 2008. Insider trading prosecutions have resulted in more than 70 convictions so far. "This sends a very, very powerful message to the entire industry," Barofsky says. So why haven't any high-profile bankers gone to jail for selling all those trash mortgages and helping to wreck the economy? "People ask me about it all the time and I try to give the best explanation I have as being inside of the system," says Barofsky, who notes that when the financial crisis hit, white-collar crime investigators already had their hands full with expanding insider trading investigations. But the government should have thrown a lot more investigators at the financial crisis, he says. William Black, a top lawyer for the Office of Thrift Supervision during the savings and loan debacle in the 1980s, agrees. "I've been saying it for years," he says. "You have to make the effort." He notes that during the savings and loan crisis, he was involved with a lot of criminal prosecutions. "At peak we had a thousand FBI agents working those cases." By comparison, Black says, when the financial crisis hit there were only 120 FBI agents working on bank fraud. And mortgage fraud cases against big financial firms are just tough cases to bring, Black says. "Insider trading is a much more understandable case for a jury, typically," he says. It's pretty simple: Somebody gets access to confidential information — say a drug trial was going badly. So they use that secret information to cheat and make a lot of money in the stock market. The financial crisis was more complicated. It involved mortgage securitizations and sophisticated investment instruments. "It would be much more difficult than the insider trading cases," says Black. After the financial crisis, the government lost a case involving Bear Stearns, the global investment bank that failed in 2008 before being sold to JPMorgan Chase. Maybe that didn't help. Also, back then the government wanted to save the banks. So maybe launching a full-scale prosecutorial assault didn't seem like the best idea. Barofsky says narratives also tend to take hold in Washington. And for the 2008 financial crisis, it's this: A lot of people on Wall Street were wrong, they made mistakes, they were greedy, but they didn't commit actual crimes. You could hear that when Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, spoke to CNBC host Jim Cramer last week. Dimon: "I think if someone did something wrong, they should go to jail." Cramer: "Well who did? Who went to jail?" Dimon: "One of the great things about America is, failure is not illegal or wrong. ... You make investments. They don't always pay off. It doesn't mean you're a criminal." Barofsky says this explanation appears to have taken root quite strongly in Washington. "That's the justification to explain the lack of cases," says Barofsky, who adds that he doesn't agree with it. "I think that there was a tremendous amount of fraud." For his part, Black says, it's not too late to prosecute financial firms that may have been involved in wrongdoing. He says scores of private civil lawsuits have uncovered evidence. Those could provide a road map for criminal prosecution. [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
1007	Typically, police arrive at the scene of a crime after it occurs. But rather than send cops to yesterday's crime, a new trend in law enforcement is using computers to predict where tomorrow's crimes will be — and then try to head them off. The software uses past statistics to project where crime is moving. Police in Los Angeles say it's worked well in predicting property crimes there. Now Seattle is about to expand it for use in predicting gun violence. It all started as a research project. Jeff Brantingham, an anthropologist at UCLA, wanted to see if computers could model future crime the same way they model earthquake aftershocks. Turns out they can. "It predicts sort of twice as much crime as any other existing system, even going head-to-head with a crime analyst," Brantingham says. Checking The Boxes Older systems, like the famous CompStat in New York, show where crime has been. This system looks forward. "The model will actually predict other locations, that effectively say, even though there was a crime somewhere else in your environment, the risk is still greatest in this location today for the next 10 hours or the next 12 hours," Brantingham explains. Brantingham and his colleagues are now selling the predictive system to police departments with the name PredPol. At this point, you may be thinking about the sci-fi movie Minority Report. But this is different. No psychics sleeping in bathtubs, for one. More to the point, this doesn't predict who will commit a future crime, just where it is likely to happen. In Seattle, police Sgt. Christi Robbin zooms in on a map of the city. Earlier this year, Seattle started using PredPol to predict property crimes. It's now the first place to try predicting gun violence with the software. "These red boxes [on the map] are predictions of where the next crimes are likely to occur," Robbin explains. At the start of every shift, patrol cops are assigned to those red boxes. "So we're asking that they spent the time in that 500-by-500-square-foot box, doing whatever proactive work they can to prevent that crime," Robbin says. On a recent shift, officer Philip Monzon pulls up inside his box; today, it's a city block near the Seattle waterfront. "[The police] want visibility, they want contacts with businesses as are appropriate, and anyone who's wandering through the area," Monzon explains. This area has parking lots, and PredPol's forecast includes car thefts. As Monzon passes a green Honda, he pauses. The guy inside seems to be ducking under the dashboard. "[I] wanna make sure to see if he's got the key or if he's gonna pull out anytime soon," Monzon says. The car starts — the guy probably does have the key. But why didn't Monzon challenge him, just in case? "I don't really have enough — I'm not just going to single out one guy in a Honda," he explains. Computer Models And 'Reasonable Suspicion' And this is where this gets tricky. The courts say police need "reasonable suspicion" in order to stop somebody. That suspicion can come from a lot of things — even someone's "furtive movements," as police like to say. But can it come from the fact that someone is occupying an imaginary red box drawn by a computer? "Ah — no. No. I don't know. I wouldn't make a stop solely on that," Monzon says. That's probably the right answer, says Andrew Guthrie Ferguson, a law professor at the University of the District of Columbia who has taken a special interest in the constitutional implications of PredPol. He says the departments using it have told police not to use it as a basis for stops. But he also wonders how long that can last. "The idea that you wouldn't use something that is actually part of the officer's suspicion and not put that in — [that] may come to a head when that officer is testifying," Ferguson says. Either that officer will have to omit the fact that he or she was prompted by PredPol, he says, or that officer will admit it on the stand. "Then the issue will be raised for the court to address."  And it may be that PredPol is a constitutional basis for stopping someone. Some might consider it more objective than an individual police officer's judgment — less prone to racism or other kinds of profiling, for example. Ferguson says that argument may have merit, but that police and society still need to be careful. "I think most people are gonna defer to the black box," he says. "Which means we need to focus on what's going into that black box, how accurate it is, and what transparency and accountability measures we have [for] it." In other words, even though computers aren't biased, the statistics feeding it might be. And if police are going to follow an algorithm, we should at least be willing to check the math.

1007	John Oliver has brought oracular authority to a three-month fill-in stint on Comedy Central this summer. With Jon Stewart off directing a film, the anchor chair at The Daily Show has been occupied by the show's senior British correspondent, John Oliver, whose own stand-up show on Comedy Central is just beginning its fourth season. Oliver tells NPR's Robert Siegel that being an anchorman is "a pretty weird experience, sitting behind that desk. I knew that I was going to have some almost comically oversized shoes to step into ... I definitely feel like a child wearing a full adult clown pair of shoes." Interview Highlights On this summer's overload of big news stories like Edward Snowden, the George Zimmerman trial, and several Supreme Court decisions "I was definitely prepared for it to be slower, and it has not worked out that way in any shape or form. I'm grateful as a comedian, and slightly demoralized, occasionally, as a human being — those two things are always very different." On his British accent "You're sonically racist, Americans. You think we all sound the same, whereas I have definitely a mongrel accent. My family are from Liverpool, so I have some twang there — I have a Midlands accent, and I was raised about an hour north of London, so my voice is a mess. Although, to American ears, it sounds like the crisp language of a queen's butler." On how stand-up audiences react to his stint as an anchorman "I don't think I'm identified as the anchorman, I think I'm identified as the impostor anchorman — there's a very clear line there ... I don't think it changes the way they respond. I mean, people, I guess, generally come to see me do stand-up with a working knowledge of my broad sense of humor on The Daily Show ... I don't think anyone would mistake me as an actual anchor. I think I'm just a summer fling that people will soon forget." On living in America "I love it here, I deeply love it here. And, you know, I guess the tone of jokes is often, at best, irreverent, but it always comes from a place of deep love. I do not want to leave here ... I cannot make that clear enough to immigration authorities who may be listening to this interview. I don't want to leave, so please don't make me. "I have a green card now, but they can take that away, yeah, they can take that away at any moment. So please don't; please let me keep it." [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
1007	Boring movie titles may not lure audiences into theaters, but they are luring users on Twitter. The #dullermovies thread challenges tweeters to pick an enticing film title and deflate it. People have come up with must-not-see films such as Ferris Bueller Goes to School and I Speculate On What You Did Last Summer. A couple of our favorites are collected below. And we invite you to share your #dullermovie titles in the comments. [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
1007	More than 10,000 athletes are meeting in Cleveland for The National Senior Games. Adults older than 55 — and some older than 90 — are running track, riding bikes, playing basketball and competing in many of the sports you might see at the Summer Olympics. In fact there are a few who were Olympians themselves back in the day who say they find that competition is just as satisfying in their later years. One of those is 82-year-old swimmer Graham Johnston. When he's not racing or getting ready to race, he's in the stands, checking out the other swimmers with an expert eye. "See," he says, pointing at one competitor, "he took a breath on the turn. Shouldn't have done that." But when it's over, he applauds and shouts "Great race" to all the swimmers. And Johnston knows a great race when he sees one. He's been swimming since the age of 2. "My father was a manager of a swimming pool," he explains. And there wasn't a lot else to do in the small South African town where he grew up. Over the decades, Johnston has set world records in various age groups for older swimmers. He's in several national and international swimming halls of fame. Back in 1952 he represented South Africa in the Olympics. But as an Olympian, he describes himself as an "also-ran." "Unfortunately, when I had to train for the Olympics, I didn't have much money and I couldn't eat very well," Johnston says. "And I probably only had one half-decent meal a day. And I think I had some malnourishment. I never got in the final. I missed the final by one position." Johnston came to the United States on a swimming scholarship from the University of Oklahoma. That's where he met his wife, Janice. It was during their freshman year. Janice says, "He just didn't swim fast enough to get away." She goes to every one of her husband's races. "I love being his cheerleader," she says. Or as her husband puts it: "She's my athletic supporter." Not only is Janice Johnston at all of her husband's races; she's at every practice too. That's five or six trips to the pool each week, every week. Johnston used to train twice a day but hasn't for the past four years. "I find I'm too tired," he says. That regimen began 40 years ago when he discovered Masters Swimming, which organizes competitions for adults. As with the Senior Games in Cleveland, competitors are grouped by age in five-year increments. And more recently, Johnston has taken up open water swimming, making the trip across the Straits of Gibraltar and swimming from the Hawaiian island of Lanai to Maui. There was "a 20-foot tiger shark in Maui one year," says Johnston with bravado, "but it wasn't hungry." Still, he knows that no amount of attitude, competition or rigorous training can defeat the toll of age. "As your body ages, all your physical equipment deteriorates," he says. "I feel a lot older and I'm getting a lot slower, but so is everybody else." He jokes that lot of his competition is already dead. "But I'm still here," he says with a chuckle. Johnston still has living competition, and he joined them in the pool for the 200-meter freestyle. He holds the Senior Games record in this event for his age group. He didn't beat the record, but he beat the guy who came in after him by 41 seconds. So Johnston got another gold medal. But he says medals have never motivated him. In fact, he's given pounds of them away to kids he's coached. He's in it for the camaraderie at the pool, he says, and the thrill of the race. "That's what makes life exciting," he says. "You've got to get that adrenaline high." And that's something that doesn't change for athletes, no matter what their age. [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
1007	U.S. sanctions mean that any citizen or business wanting to buy stuff from North Korea has to send a letter to the U.S. government asking for special permission. A few months back, we submitted a Freedom of Information Act request, asking for those letters. Our request was granted: We recently received a packet of 18 letters from Americans who wanted to do business with the most isolated nation on the planet. We've posted all of the letters online. We also managed to track down some of the people who wrote the letters. Here's what we learned: Stamps Donald Sundman, president of Mystic Stamp Co. in Camden, N.Y., asked for permission to buy postage stamps from North Korea. Some North Korean stamps show pictures of dogs. There's at least one that, weirdly, has a picture of Princess Diana. Another, less weirdly, has a picture of a unified Korean peninsula. Sundman told me he wanted to get the stamps because, basically, they're hard to get — which makes them appealing for some collectors. This is one theme in the requests to do business with North Korea: People don't want North Korean stuff because it's cheap or well-made; people want the stuff because it's hard to get. They want special permission to buy stuff because the sanctions make it hard to buy stuff. Jeans Patrick Forster, CFO of a Coca-Cola bottling plant in Tennessee, asked for permission to buy a pair of $220 jeans that were made in North Korea. He told me he thought they'd make a nice birthday present for his wife, whose father escaped from North Korea during the war. The government granted his request. "She's only worn them one time," he said. "They didn't fit quite right." The jeans are called NoKo jeans, and they're the brainchild of a few young Swedish guys who, on a whim, managed to get 1,100 pairs of jeans made in North Korea — despite the fact that jeans are seen as a symbol of imperialism in the country. "We didn't use the word 'jeans' during the production," Tor Kallstigen told me. "The company was called Pants Provided." Beer One guy wanted to import North Korean beer. I couldn't track him down, but I did find a guy who had tasted it. Josh Thomas, a graphic designer in Hong Kong, told me it tastes just like Anchor Steam. He said North Korea bought a brewery in the U.K. and brought it over to North Korea. I don't know whether the request to import North Korean beer was granted, but I've never seen North Korean beer in this country. Thomas says he tried to bring some back to Hong Kong with him. The bottles weren't very well-made, and when the barometric pressure dropped, they burst. For More: Listen to our show, The North Korea Files. [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
1007	David Niven's been dead for 30 years, so he can't be behind this: "A Bosnian from the 'Pink Panther' gang of international jewel thieves escaped from a Swiss prison in a dramatic break-out involving a fellow inmate and two armed accomplices, police said Friday." (Agence France-Presse, via GlobalPost) According to AFP, "Milan Poparic, who was serving a sentence of almost seven years for a 2009 robbery at a jewelery store, is the third 'Pink Panther' to escape from a Swiss prison since May." As you might expect, Friday's escape reportedly involved a van that rammed through a gate, ladders that were used to get above barbed wire and gunfire from automatic weapons. No one was hurt, AFP says. This gang earned the "Pink Panther" nickname because they once hid a diamond ring in a jar of face cream — just like the crooks did in one of the Pink Panther movies. As The New Yorker has written about the modern-day gang: "All told, the Panthers have performed hundreds of robberies all over the world. The gang's cinematic name is an invention of the press: the police, after raiding one thief's apartment, found a blue-diamond ring, worth seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars, hidden inside a jar of face cream; a similar hiding place was used in one of the Peter Sellers films." Oh, and about that David Niven reference. Here's how IMDB.com begins its synopsis of the plot of 1963's The Pink Panther: "As a child, Princess Dala receives a gift from her father, the Shah of Lugash: the Pink Panther, the largest diamond in the world. This huge pink gem has an unusual flaw: looking deeply into the stone, one perceives a tiny discoloration resembling a leaping pink panther hence the name. As the camera moves in, this image comes to life and participates in the credits. When Dala is a young woman, rebels seize power in Lugash and then demand possession of the jewel, but the exiled princess refuses to hand it over. "Dala (Claudia Cardinale) relaxes on holiday at an exclusive skiing resort in Cortina d'Ampezzo, where noted British playboy Sir Charles Lytton (David Niven), who leads a secret life as a jewel thief called 'The Phantom,' has his eyes on the Pink Panther. His American playboy nephew, George (Robert Wagner), follows his uncle to the resort hoping to steal the jewel and blame it on the Phantom, not realizing that the Phantom is his uncle." Peter Sellers, the original Inspector Clouseau in the movies, died in 1980. Herbert Lom, who played the exasperated police chief Dreyfus, died in 2012. The movies' director, Blake Edwards, died in 2010. [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
1007	"Genocide in Indonesia." Those words probably don't make you want to rush out to see a new movie. But what if we add these: Genocide in Indonesia, with gangsters, cowboys, dancing girls, men in drag and splashy musical numbers. They're all part of the year's strangest documentary, The Act of Killing. The opening looks like something from a demented Bollywood musical. Costumed girls come dancing out of the mouth of a giant fish, frolicking under a waterfall as a director barks at them to look happy, happier. Standing with them, also getting soaked, are two men, one slender and dressed as a priest, the other fat, in a turquoise satin gown. These two are notorious Indonesian death-squad leaders — men who slaughtered countless civilians they accused of being communists after a military takeover in 1965. And they are not shy in talking about what they've done. But the filmmakers didn't want a talking-heads documentary, so they offered them a different option: re-enact their stories in whatever cinematic style they like. They like mob movies, and musicals. And this bizarre scene is part of one such re-enactment. The slender man in black is executioner Anwar Congo. The heavyset man gowned in turquoise is paramilitary leader Herman Koto, who is not only enthusiastic about dressing like Carmen Miranda, but also eager to recruit extras for the film's retellings of horrifying events. He holds auditions in the street, urging people too young to have been alive during the actual atrocities to scream as if their families are being killed. A crowd has gathered and applauds. Filmmaker Joshua Oppenheimer is obviously treading on dicey moral ground here, empowering killers to tell their story when they've never been called to account for the barbarism that brought them to power. By some estimates, more than 1.2 million civilians were slaughtered in these Indonesian upheavals, which makes it somewhat unnerving when these men say that films inspired them in their sadism. They picked up strangulation techniques, for instance, from gangster flicks. Congo, playing a victim at one point, has just such a technique used on him, to his quite evident distress. But in public he shows no doubts, even appearing on TV, where a telegenic interviewer congratulates him for having found an efficient, humane way of killing communists. Back in the TV control room, a producer wonders how these guys can sleep. As will you once they've restaged their killings for Oppenheimer's cameras, sometimes in stylized ways, other times with a realism so wrenching the extras are left almost catatonic in a scene's wake. Play-acting with murderers. Not sure I'd want that on my resume — and with easily two-thirds of the performers and technicians listed in the end credits as "anonymous," it's clear many of the crew found the idea disquieting, too. But there's a reason that two great documentary filmmakers — Werner Herzog and Errol Morris — signed on to produce The Act of Killing. It's a virtually unprecedented social document. Time after time, Oppenheimer highlights jaw-dropping disconnects — killers proud of the fact that they simply made up the charges for which they executed people; thugs comforting children who've been told to cry for a scene, but then can't stop; a strangulation scene interrupted by the call to evening prayers; gangsters laughing about the 14-year-olds they raped. But the disconnects aren't the whole film. For in having these monsters re-create their atrocities for the camera, a space has been opened ... for feeling. And the filmmakers show you what may be the first consequence of opening that space, as one man is hit, almost physically, by the reality of what he has done, and then walks out of the scene without a word. The Act of Killing, which may leave you speechless too, is one of the most arresting acts of cinema around. (Recommended) [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
1007	Army Pfc. Bradley Manning was not aiding the enemy when he leaked the largest cache of classified information in the history of the United States, the defense argued today during closing arguments of his military trial in Fort Meade, Maryland, today. Instead, he released the information in an attempt to spark debate about things he found troubling about war and American diplomacy. CBS News reports that Manning's civilian defense attorney David Coombs said Manning is a whistleblower not a traitor. CBS reports: "Coombs said the prosecution cherry-picked Manning's chats with convicted computer hacker Adrian Lamo to make their case. He urged the judge to read the entire chat log to put things in context. "For example, he said the prosecution cited a line Manning wrote to Lamo: 'If you had unprecedented access to classified networks, 14 hours a day, seven days a week, for eight-plus months, what would you do?' "Coombs pointed out Manning also wrote, 'Hypothetical question: If you had free reign over classified networks over a long period of time, if you saw incredible things, awful things, things that belonged in the public domain and not on some server stored in a dark room in Washington, D.C., what would you do?'" As we've told you before: Manning has already admitted that he gave classified information to WikiLeaks. But he has denied the most serious charge he's faced with: aiding the enemy, a charge punishable by life in prison. At issue in this case is whether Manning knowingly provided intelligence to enemies of the U.S. During their more than five-hour closing arguments yesterday, prosecutors argued Manning was reckless and that he released information to WikiLeaks — instead of traditional news outlets — because he wanted the data to be available in an indiscriminate manner. The closing arguments are still ongoing. We'll update this post with more a little later on. Manning's fate will be decided by Army Col. Denise Lind, a military judge. Manning requested a judge decide his case instead of a jury. Update at 8:57 p.m. ET. Case In Judge's Hand:  Bradley Manning's fate is now in the hands of Army Col. Denise Lind, the military judge presiding over the case.  "Lind will deliberate over the weekend and will give a day's notice ahead of her verdict," ABC News reports. "Once a verdict is announced the sentencing phase of the court martial is scheduled to begin next Wednesday." [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
1007	At the request of Egypt's army chief, Gen. Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, many Egyptians took to the street Friday to give him a mandate for what he calls a "war against terrorism" on Islamists. His call drew a huge response from those opposed to Mohammed Morsi, but it also brought out large numbers of supporters of the ousted president who is allied with the Muslim Brotherhood. As the following photographs show, anti-Morsi protesters rallied in Cairo's Tahrir Square ... ... while those allied with Morsi gathered near the Rabaa al-Adawiya mosque. [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
1007	Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former head of the International Monetary Fund who was forced to resign amid allegations of sexual misconduct in the U.S., faces charges of "aggravated pimping" before a court in his native France. A trial date has not been set. Strauss-Kahn, 64, stepped down as head of the IMF in 2011 after he was accused of sexually assaulting a New York hotel maid. Although those charges were later dropped, they derailed the politician's plans to run for the French presidency. In 2012, prosecutors accused Strauss-Kahn of involvement in a prostitution ring in the northern city of Lille. On Friday, authorities said they would go ahead with formal charges in the case. The Associated Press, quoting judicial officials, says that prostitutes questioned in the case said they had sex with Strauss-Kahn in 2010 and 2011 in France and also in Washington, D.C., where he lived while working at the IMF. In France, it is not against the law to pay for sex and, as Reuters reports, "pimping is a broad crime that encompasses aiding or encouraging prostitution." However, the news agency says, "Because the parties allegedly involved several prostitutes, Strauss-Kahn will stand trial in Lille on the more serious charge of aggravated pimping, which carries a maximum term of 10 years in prison and a $2 million fine." Strauss-Kahn, who has maintained that he has been unfairly targeted because of his lavish lifestyle, has acknowledged attending sex parties but says he was not aware the women were being paid for their services.

1007	It seems like the Midwest is a hotbed for medical mysteries these days. Earlier this week, scientists traced a brand-new virus to ticks in Missouri. Now disease detectives are hot on the trail of another puzzling pathogen in the heartland. A stomach bug has sickened at least 321 people across 14 states, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. The source of the outbreak is still unknown, though the parasite that's causing the outbreak, cyclospora, is usually found in food. About 90 percent of the cases have been reported in Iowa, Texas and Nebraska. But the bug has also cropped up in the Southeast and New England. Health officials say they still don't know how cyclospora is making it into people's meals. Most of us aren't familiar with cyclospora, and that's a good thing. The parasite, which likes to hang out on fresh fruits and vegetables, causes a rather nasty bout of diarrhea that can last weeks. "It's a tenacious critter," Dr. William Schaffner from Vanderbilt University told CBS News Thursday. "It can produce a prolonged, watery, very uncomfortable diarrhea." And the bug doesn't stop there. "What's unique to this parasite is that it causes anorexia," or lack of appetite, says Ynes Ortega, from the University of Georgia's Food Safety Center. "People lose a lot of weight, very fast." "I have a friend who got the disease, and she said it was like being pregnant at first," Ortega told Shots. "Even the sight or smell of food makes you nauseous." It's not the worst parasite out there, Ortega says. But it can put you in the hospital if you have a weakened immune system or another underlying illness. At least 18 people have been hospitalized in the current outbreak. The good news, Ortega says, is that the treatment for cyclospora is fast and effective. Sulfa drugs wipe out the infection quickly. Cyclospora is relatively rare in the U.S. Most food poisonings here are caused by bacteria or viruses, like E. coli and norovirus. In contrast, cyclospora is a protozoan, which typically hangs out in tropical and subtropical regions. "We never realized that this parasite would come into the developed world," Ortega says. "Travelers would get it when they ate contaminated fruits and vegetables in communities with poor sanitation." But since the U.S. started importing more of its produce, cyclospora has been tagging along. The first large outbreak occurred in 1996 and affected about 1,000 people. The CDC recorded 4,100 cases between 1997 and 2008. Often times, farm workers get the bug on their hands and then transfer it to produce. Previous outbreaks in the U.S. have been linked to basil, snow peas and raspberries. But any fresh fruit or vegetable can carry the bug. So until health officials pinpoint the source of the cyclospora, people should wash all their fruits and vegetables thoroughly. "You can reduce the number of organisms on produce by washing it well," Ortega says. But to get rid of parasites completely, food has to be cooked. Sanitizers and bleach aren't going to work either. People with watery diarrhea and other symptoms of cyclospora should contact their doctors, Ortega says. "This will help the CDC figure out just how wide spread the outbreak is and track down the source." [Copyright 2013 NPR]

1007	Sam Simon, who helped create The Simpsons and continues to earn "tens of millions" of dollars each year from royalties generated by the show, is dying from colon cancer. Doctors say he has less than six months to live. Here's the part of his story we especially want to pass along: When he's gone, the 58-year-old writer and producer says, his Simpsons royalties will go to charity. The donations will come on top of the millions he's given away since striking it rich as a younger man. As The Hollywood Reporter says: "His contributions include founding the Malibu-based Sam Simon Foundation (worth nearly $23 million as of 2011) that rescues the hungry (humans — but with vegan foods only) and strays (dogs, of any variety). His other pet charities include PETA, which in February thanked him for his support by naming its Norfolk, Va., headquarters the Sam Simon Center; international nonprofit Save the Children; and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, a global marine conservation organization. His contributions led it to name one of the four ships in its fleet of vessels, used to hinder whaling and illegal fishing, the M/Y Simon in 2012. He also turned a Malibu spread into a canine haven that rescues dogs from kill shelters and trains them as companions for the deaf." Simon, whose other TV projects have included The Drew Carey Show and Anger Management, has no children and isn't now married. He says he isn't sure how much the royalties will be worth to charities after he's gone, but that it will be a lot. In an interview with the Reporter, he's asked about what's happened to him and the decision to give away his money: "THR: Do you get frustrated with bad things happening to good people? Like, why didn't someone else get this cancer? "Simon: No. I don't think that's what karma is. It never crossed my mind. But I don't think the spirit of Hollywood is such a spirit of generosity. I think people really begrudge giving. In New York, it's like that. A lot of charities spend a million dollars on a fundraiser to make $15,000. It's a social swirl. They do some great stuff and then — it's called mission drift. It becomes more about the parties. You know, I'm not married, and I don't have kids. I had an emergency operation when I was septic, and I really did come very close to dying. My colon cancer perforated my colon. When I woke up in the hospital, even though I did have a will, it did become that much more important to me to set this stuff up for the future. And the Rockefeller Foundation has consultants [Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors] who have been amazing. We found fantastic trustees. It's something that will be living after I'm gone." Back in May, Simon talked at length about all this on the WTF with Marc Maron podcast (for the record, there's a considerable amount of "adult" language during that interview). [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
1007	We recorded this week's episode during the brief interregnum between the end of Glen Weldon's trip to the San Diego Comic Con and the beginning of Linda Holmes' two weeks at the Television Critics Association press tour in Los Angeles. So it seemed a perfect time to mine the two events for inspiration. First, we get a sense from Glen — whose name is Welsh for "he who is uneasy around people" — of what it was like to be flushed into a sea of 130,000 enthusiastic souls; his answer may or may not surprise you. And, from there, we talk about fan gatherings of many different stripes. I talk a little South by Southwest and Newport Folk Festival (the latter of which I'm attending this weekend, so be sure to say hello!), guest panelist and departing producer Jess Gitner explains why she prefers chairs and the Internet, and Linda tells a story of how a small organic fan meet-up can suffer under the weight of expectations. Then it's on to a briefing from Linda in advance of her trip to TCA: trends in fall television, what it's like to tromp through the Big Brother house, the return of Michael J. Fox, the pending rise of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., a surefire sign that shows will fail, how broadcast networks hope to survive the encroaching domination of cable and the Internet, and more. And, as always, we close with What's Making Us Happy. Jess thanks folks for the kind words about her imminent departure, then praises a fun pop-music remix. Glen praises a new book about the world of comic books — and is so sure you'll love it, he urges you to buy it without first peeking at its pages. I'm giddy with anticipation for the Newport Folk Festival, as one tends to be, and brimming with praise for recent articles by my pals Glen and Linda. Linda cites an inspiring comment on her aforementioned essay, and urges everyone to check out the 13-year-old commenter's charming and imaginative work on YouTube. And, of course, we pay tribute to our departing pal Jess, who really is as great and good as we say she is. Find us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter: Linda, Glen, Jess, me, absent Trey, and our esteemed producer emeritus and music director, Mike Katzif. [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
1007	Nobody throws away a mason jar on Prince of Wales Island. On this rugged mass of mountain, forest, river and sea in southeast Alaska, most of the several thousand year-round residents subsist at least partially off the generous fat of the land. And much of the bounty is pressure cooked, preserved and stored away for the future. "If it stops crawling long enough, we'll put it in a jar," says Jon Rowan, a schoolteacher in the town of Klawock, on the island's west side. Rowan hunts, harvests and cans nearly every sort of creature that lives in the diverse, rain-drenched ecosystem of the region. His cellar is crammed with hundreds of jars of salmon, halibut, rockfish, lingcod, deer and even seal, which Rowan can legally shoot because he — like many of the island's several thousand people — has Native American roots. Seal blubber, Rowan says, is cooked for hours before going into the jar. It may be used for cooking or simply melted over rice — "kind of like how you use soy sauce at a Chinese restaurant," Rowan says. The meat of local seals is also canned. "It tastes like really rich duck," Rowan says. Mary Anna Murphy is one of only two permanent residents of the small Wadleigh Island, which flanks the west central shore of Prince of Wales (locals call it POW) just two miles from Klawock. On her 17-foot Boston Whaler, Murphy regularly makes the two-mile commute to town — often to bring jars of home-canned goods to her friends. Murphy — who has been certified as a "master canner" through a weeklong course in Juneau — keeps her pantry stocked with jars of salmon, halibut and deer, which Murphy says she usually shoots from her bedroom window. "I still have shells on the floor," she deadpans. Murphy has at times cooked and jarred black bear. She says bear meat can cause flatulence but otherwise is delicious. "You can render down the oil, too," she says. "I fry shrimp in it, and you'd swear it was olive oil." Vegetarians — if any exist on and around Prince of Wales Island — may also find themselves in a land of plenty here. Many of the local fruits and veggies are seasonal. But locals can make sea asparagus, kelp, fiddlehead ferns, spruce tips, wild mushrooms, huckleberries and salmonberries last all year by boiling jars full of these and other goodies in giant stove-top pressure cookers, which cause the containers to vacuum seal as they cool. Of course, such foods can also be dried or frozen, but canning offers unique benefits. The foods can last years without deteriorating or developing freezer burn, and they are ready to eat upon opening. And on an island where a latte costs $6, a fresh watermelon $15, and a can of salmon $10, residents may pinch pennies when they're able and can their own foods to save on the cost of a freezer. For most locals, the canning season begins in the spring, when the mighty Chinook — the biggest, greasiest and most succulent of the salmon clan — swarm local coves and seaward channels. In June and July, 3- to 5-pound pink salmon arrive by the millions, gathering in schools near shore before surging up almost every river, stream, brook and crick (outsiders say "creek") to spawn. Sockeye salmon, chum salmon and Coho salmon arrive in succeeding waves. Sitka black-tailed deer can be hunted several months of the year, and state law allows residents to take four annually. Mushrooms like porcini, chanterelles and shaggy manes burst from the mossy rainforest floor in late summer. Coral-like sulfur shelf mushrooms, called chicken-of-the-forest by islanders, balloon out of tree trunks and stumps in the fall. Kelp thrives in the almost everlasting sunlight of summer. All the while, countless mason jars make their own migrations within the small communities of Prince of Wales, cycling repeatedly from sink to pressure cooker to pantry, and back again. Lids cannot be reused, and islanders know where the best deals can be found on canning accessories. In South Thorne Bay, on the northeast side of the island, Tony and Jenny Wise own an idyllic home and garden on a hillside, replete with goats, chickens, veggies and one of the loneliest apple trees in the world. Like so many Prince of Wales residents, the Wises pack away almost countless jars of edibles for storage each year. They use a model 921 All American pressure cooker, which can fit 16 one-pint jars at once. The total time it takes to jar fish is about three hours, including 120 minutes of high-pressure cooking. Jenny adds nothing to a jar of salmon except salt. "That way, you can do whatever you want with it when you open it," she says.

1007	Prosecutors said a large volume of evidence including electronic messages, court-ordered wiretaps and consensual recordings is stacked against a Connecticut-based hedge fund that pleaded not guilty Friday to criminal charges accusing it of letting insider trading flourish for more than a decade. Assistant U.S. Attorney Antonia Apps told a federal judge in Manhattan that investigators had &#8220;voluminous&#8221; evidence against SAC Capital Advisors, a Stamford, Conn.-based firm owned by billionaire Steven A. Cohen. She said the evidence included &#8220;electronic messages, instant messages, court-ordered wiretaps and consensual recordings.&#8221; The plea was entered by Peter Nussbaum, SAC&#8217;s longtime general counsel, and came a day after the company was charged with wire and securities fraud, accused of making hundreds of millions of dollars illegally. Federal prosecutors described a culture at SAC that permitted, if not encouraged, insider trading. Prosecutors said the victims were large companies whose inside information was stolen and traded upon. The next hearing was set for Sept. 24. GuestMarty Schenker, executive editor at Bloomberg.

1007	The train derailment in Spain is the latest in a series of disasters this year that have been caught on video and been played over and over again in the media. There was the meteorite that hit Russia, the Asiana Airlines crash landing in San Francisco and the oil train explosion in Quebec. What kind of psychological effect does that repeated exposure to tragic disaster imagery have on us? Suddenly we’re part of an international community of mourners, and I think that feels satisfying to us.&ndash;Eric Wilson &#8220;I think it does quite a few things to us,&#8221; Eric Wilson, author of &#8220;Everyone Loves A Good Train Wreck: Why We Can&#8217;t Look Away&#8221; told Here & Now. &#8220;Too much can actually be traumatic for someone watching. Also, watching these videos too much can lead to a numbness.&#8221; Trying to get media outlets not to show the videos is not the answer, Wilson said. &#8220;It&#8217;s up to the viewers to choose how often we watch these videos and ultimately figure out why we&#8217;re watching these videos. It we&#8217;re doing it for a cheap thrill, obviously we should question ourselves. If in the midst of watching these videos we&#8217;re thinking more deeply about suffering and the meaning of death then perhaps meditating on these videos isn&#8217;t such a bad thing,&#8221; he said. When there is a major disaster, people may feel compelled to watch the videos as a way of connecting to what&#8217;s happening. &#8220;In a world where we often feel isolated, where we often feel trapped in front of our own computer screen, trapped in our own rooms having virtual experiences not real contact, suddenly we&#8217;re part of an international community of mourners, and I think that feels satisfying to us,&#8221; Wilson said. &#8220;We are all at the same time mourning this tragedy in Spain.&#8221; While some people may be desensitized by disaster videos, others may have the opposite experience.

1007	&#8220;The Engagements,&#8221; the new novel by J. Courtney Sullivan interweaves four tales about the significance of diamonds with the real-life story of Frances Gerety, who was a copywriter with the Philadelphia ad agency N.W. Ayer and Son beginning in the 1940s. Advertising Age magazine named “A Diamond is Forever,” the phrase that Gerety penned to help promote the De Beers company’s products, the slogan of the 20th century. Gerety herself was never married. “She really created these romantic ideas that we now associate with diamonds, but she herself was not romantic in anyway, it didn’t interest her” Sullivan said. “Because she was living in a time when really, a woman had to decide: Do I want to follow a career path or do I want to be married?” Gerety struggled under the glass ceiling at Ayer, and the company didn’t recognize her contributions until she was much older. &#8220;I came to really love her so much over the course of writing this book,&#8221; Sullivan said. Amnesty International: Conflict DiamondsBook Excerpt: &#8216;The Engagements&#8217; By J. Courtney Sullivan 1947 Frances poured the last bitter remains of the coffeepot into her cup. The small kitchen table was covered in paper: layouts, copies of confidential reports, lousy ideas she had scrapped hours ago, and good ones, already published in Look, Vogue, The Saturday Evening Post, Life, and Harper’s Bazaar, to remind her that she had done it before and could do it again. For once, the apartment building was silent. Usually, from off in some distant corner she could hear a baby crying, a couple arguing, a toilet flushing. But it was past three a.m. The revelers had long been asleep, and the milkmen weren’t yet awake. Her roommate had gone to bed around ten— at the sight of her standing there in her nightgown and curlers, Frances was overcome with professional jealousy, even though Ann was only a secretary in a law office, who would spend tomorrow the same way she spent every day, fetching coffee and taking dictation. Frances had just finished writing the newest De Beers copy, a honeymoon series with pictures of pretty places newlyweds might go— the rocky coast of Maine! Arizona! Paris! And something generic for people without much money, which she labeled By the river. In a way, that one was the most important of them all, since they were trying to appeal to the average Joe. A decade earlier, when De Beers first came on as a client, the agency had done a lot of surveying to find out the strength— or really the weakness— of the diamond engagement ring tradition. In those days, not many women had wanted one. It was considered just absolutely money down the drain. They’d take a washing machine or a new car, anything but an expensive diamond ring. She had helped to change all that. The honeymoon ads read, May your happiness last as long as your diamond. A pretty good line, she thought. “Time for bed, Frank,” she whispered to herself, the same words her mother had whispered to her every night when she was a child. She was just about to switch off the light when she saw the blank signature line that the art director had drawn on the layouts, which she was meant to fill in by morning. “Rats.” Frances sat back down, lit a cigarette, and picked up a pencil. A day earlier, Gerry Lauck, head of the New York office, had called her. “I think we should have something that identifies this as diamond advertising,” he said. “A signature line. What do you think?” When Gerry Lauck asked what you thought, it was wise to understand that he was not actually asking. In her opinion, the man was a genius. Unpredictable and a bit gloomy at times, but perhaps all geniuses were like that. “Yes, perfect,” she said. Gerry looked like Winston Churchill, he acted like Winston Churchill, and sometimes Frances believed he thought he was Winston Churchill. He even had fits of depression. The first time she had to go to New York to show him her ideas, she was scared to death. Gerry looked them over, his face giving no indication of what he thought. After several torturous minutes, he smiled and said, “Frances, you write beautifully. More important, you know how to sell.” They had liked each other ever since. Half the employees of N. W. Ayer were afraid of Gerry Lauck, or couldn’t stand him. The other half thought he hung the moon, and Frances was one of them. “The line shouldn’t say anything about De Beers, of course,” Gerry continued over the phone. “Of course.” For nine years, De Beers had spent millions on ads that barely mentioned the company itself. To even name it as a distributor would be breaking the law. So the advertisements were simply for diamonds, and they were beautiful. Ayer pulled out all the stops. They couldn’t show pictures of diamond jewelry in the ads, which left the art department in a pickle. In theory, Gerry had nothing to do with creative. He was a straight-up businessman and just handed out the assignments. But as an art lover, he thought to commission a series of original paintings from Lucioni, Berman, Lamotte, and Dame Laura Knight. He purchased preexisting works from some of the finest galleries in Europe for the De Beers collection, by Dalí, Picasso, and Edzard. The resulting four- color ads showed gorgeous landscapes, cities, cathedrals. Printed on the page, just below the artist’s creation, would be a box displaying illustrations of stones, ranging from half a carat to three carats, along with approximate prices for each. Gerry was the first person to create an ad campaign featuring fine art. A year or two later, everyone in the business was doing it. “I’ll need the tagline by tomorrow,” Gerry said. “I’ll be in to Philadelphia in the morning and then on to South Africa by late afternoon.” “Sure thing,” Frances said, and then promptly forgot all about it until now, the middle of the night. She sighed. If she hadn’t been bucking all her life for the title of World’s Biggest Procrastinator, maybe she ’d get some sleep one of these days. She knew she had to work tonight, but still she had stayed out with her pal Dorothy Dignam until Dorothy had to catch the nine o’clock train back to Penn Station. Dorothy started as an Ayer copywriter in the Philadelphia office in 1930, but soon after Frances came to the agency four years back, Dorothy moved to the New York office at 30 Rockefeller Center to head up the public relations department. Like Frances, De Beers was her main priority. They had publicists in Miami, Hollywood, and Paris, too, just for this one client. Dorothy had even arranged for the creation of a short film with Columbia Pictures, The Magic Stone: Diamonds Through the Centuries. It started playing in theaters in September 1945 and by the time the run was over, it had been seen by more than fifteen million people. Her friend would never tell her age, but Frances guessed that Dorothy was at least a decade and a half older than she was, probably about fifty. She had been in advertising in Chicago in the last year of the First World War. She was the Chicago Herald’s society reporter at seventeen years old and stayed until the day Mr. Hearst moved in and moved her out. She went from there to the offices of the Contented Cow milk company as a copywriter, and later to Ayer. Dorothy was a real hot ticket. She was something of a model for Frances. She had traveled the world for Ayer in the thirties, working in London, Paris, and Geneva for Ford, sailing to Norway and Sweden to study household electrical progress. She even made frequent visits to Hollywood, where she went to the Trocadero for dinner and saw all the stars. She once ran into Joan Crawford in Bullocks Wilshire. Dorothy bought size 16 of the dress that Joan had purchased in size 14. Just an inexpensive black daytime frock and very useful to both of us, I’m sure was how she had described it in a postcard she sent. Their dinner tonight had started off as a business meeting, but after two martinis each they were laughing uproariously at a table at Bookbinder’s, eating oysters and telling jokes about the fellas at work. They were endlessly amused by the things they were expected to know as women in the office. A few years ago, Dorothy started keeping a sheet of paper in the vacant drawer under her typewriter, and every question that was asked of her, she typed down. Tonight, she had read Frances a few of the latest: “How should a woman look when her son is seventeen? Could a winter hat have a bird’s nest on it? Is Macy’s singular or plural? Do women ever warble in the bathtub? What’s the difference between suede and buck? Does Queen Mary have a nice complexion? How many times a day do you feed a baby? Is this thing an inverted pleat?” They had had a ball, but now Frances would have to pay the price. She glanced at a sheet of paper, a recent strategy plan, and read, We are dealing primarily with a problem in mass psychology. We seek to maintain and strengthen the tradition of the diamond engagement ring— to make it a psychological necessity. Target audience: some seventy million people fifteen years and over whose opinion we hope to influence in support of our objectives. Well, that narrowed it down nicely. In 1938, a representative of Sir Ernest Oppenheimer, president of De Beers Consolidated Mines, wrote to Ayer to inquire whether, as he put it, “the use of propaganda in various forms” might boost the sales of diamonds in America. The Depression had caused diamond prices to plummet around the world. Consumer interest had all but vanished. There were only half as many diamonds sold in America as there had been before the war, and the few diamond engagement rings still being purchased were inexpensive and small. De Beers had reserve stocks they couldn’t possibly sell. Oppenheimer was eager to bring the diamond engagement ring to prominence in the United States, and he had it on good authority that Ayer was the best in the business, the only agency for the job. He proposed a campaign at $500,000 annually for the first three years. What Ayer had done for De Beers was a true testament to the power of advertising. By 1941, diamond sales had increased by 55 percent. After the Second World War, the number of weddings in America soared, and diamonds went right along with them. The price of diamonds went up, too: Today, a two- carat diamond could range in price from $1,500 to $3,300. In 1939, it would have been $900 to $1,750. They had created a whole new sort of advertising for this campaign, and other agencies had been copying it ever since. In the absence of a direct sale to be made, or a brand name to be introduced, there was only an idea: the emotional currency attached to a diamond. De Beers produced less than they could, to keep supply low and price high. Not only did their advertising approach boost sales, it also ensured that, once sold, a diamond would never return to the marketplace. After Frances got finished pulling their heartstrings, widows or even divorcées would not want to part with their rings. On occasion over the years, she had imagined what the Oppenheimers must look like. The peculiar particulars of their relationship stoked her imagination, making her wonder what their faces did when they saw her newest ideas. Were there raised eyebrows? Slight smiles? Exclamations? It was unusual for her not to have met a client, but De Beers was prohibited from coming to the United States because of the cartel. The company controlled the world supply of rough diamonds, a monopoly so strong that the mere presence of its representatives in America violated the law. They operated out of Johannesburg and London. Once a year, Gerry Lauck took the ads she wrote to South Africa in a thick leatherbound book for their approval. He kept a set of golf clubs there, since it was easier than lugging them back and forth from New York. The fi rst time Gerry went to Johannesburg to present market research to the Oppenheimers, the small seaplane he was traveling on made a crash landing off the Island of Mozambique. He used the large mounted maps and charts he had brought along as flotation devices to get to shore. Two others on board died, and The New York Times ran the headline airliner is wrecked in southeast africa: american escapes injury. Gerry felt that the presentation quite literally saved his life, and perhaps for that reason, he was willing to do whatever it took for De Beers. Her roommate let out a great snore in the next room, interrupting Frances’s thoughts. Ann was waiting on a marriage proposal from a dull accountant she had been dating for a while now. After that, Frances would be back on the hunt for a new roommate, as had tended to happen every few months or so since the war ended. Rose, Myrtle, Hildy: one by one, she had lost them all to matrimony. But she was up for a promotion at the office, so perhaps when Ann left she could finally afford to live alone. When Frances started working at Ayer four years ago, at the age of twenty- eight, she had convinced her parents that it was time for her to move away from home and into the city. But her paycheck demanded that she get a roommate to help with the rent. She wanted a house of her own on the Main Line. Then she ’d never have to worry about getting enough hot water in the shower on winter mornings, or tolerating Ann’s nasally soprano as she accompanied Dinah Shore on the radio at night. She relished and  reamed about the prospect of living alone, the same way most single girls probably dreamed about married life. Frances ran a finger over one of her new honeymoon ads. Other women never seemed to think about what came next. They were so eager to be paired up, as if marriage was known to be full of splendor. Frances was the opposite: she could never stop thinking about it. She might go to dinner or out dancing with someone new, and have a fi ne time. But when she got home and climbed into bed afterward, her heart would race with fear. If she went out with him again, then they might go out again after that. Eventually, she would have to take him home to be evaluated by her parents, and vice versa. Then he would propose. And she, like all the other working girls who had married before her, would simply disappear into a life of motherhood and isolation. Excerpted from the book THE ENGAGEMENTS by J. Courtney Sullivan.

1007	San Diego Mayor Bob Filner said Friday he will undergo therapy after less than a year in office amid allegations that he sexually harassed women. Filner announced his plans after a series of women claimed he kissed, groped and placed them in headlocks. Filner apologized to voters, his staff and the women he allegedly harassed, but added: &#8220;Words alone are not enough. I am responsible for my conduct. And I must take responsibly for my conduct.&#8221; The allegations resulted in widespread calls for him to resign, plunging the nation&#8217;s eighth-largest city into political turmoil. When the allegations surfaced, Filner apologized for disrespecting women and said he needed help. But soon after, he said he was innocent of sexual harassment and resisted calls to leave office. The chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee called on Filner to resign as did leaders of the San Diego Democratic party. The former congressman was San Diego&#8217;s first Democratic mayor in 20 years. Filner&#8217;s own political party called for the leader of the nation&#8217;s eighth-largest city to resign as four more women identified themselves as targets of his sexual harassment, bringing to seven the number of women who have offered detailed accounts that include unwanted touching.

1007	Rajiv Chandrasekaran was Baghdad bureau chief for the Washington Post in 2003 and 2004. During that time, he hired several Iraqis to work as interpreters or drivers. Many of them eventually came to the U.S. If guys like Omar can go back, maybe they can accomplish what the United States military and the U.S. government so profoundly failed to do.&ndash;Rajiv Chandrasekaran This year, which marked the 10th anniversary of the start of the war, Chandrasekaran set out to find the Iraqis who worked for the post during the war, to find out how their lives are going in America. Omar Fekeiki was one of those Iraqis. He worked as an interpreter and special correspondent for the Washington Post in Baghdad from 2003 to 2006. He got the job by accident. &#8220;It was a pure coincidence, actually,&#8221; Fekeiki told Here & Now. &#8220;I was trying to get a phone to call my relatives in London to tell them that we survived the war, and the only way to do that was to try to get one of the journalists who were covering Iraq to lend me the phone. A few minutes later I found this foreign journalist, who happened to be Mary Beth Sheridon of the Post, trying to converse with Iraqis, but they didn&#8217;t speak English, she didn&#8217;t speak Arabic, and I volunteered to translate. And 30 minutes, 45 minutes later she introduced me to Rajiv who actually offered me the job on the spot, as a translator.&#8221; Today, Fekeiki lives in Landover, Maryland. He&#8217;s an assignment editor for Radio Sawa, a U.S.-funded station that beams news and pop music across the Arab world. He hopes to return home to help his country. &#8220;This time when I go back to Iraq, I&#8217;m going to have an even bigger responsibility, because now I am going to be the American who is back to help Iraqis. And then my countrymen, Iraqis and Americans &#8212; funny to say that &#8212; will realize that we can co-exist and we can help each other and it doesn&#8217;t have to be a failure, like it has been in the last ten years,&#8221; Fekeiki said.

1007	The second juror to speak publicly told ABC News that she feels George Zimmerman got away with murder for fatally shooting Trayvon Martin, but that there wasn&#8217;t enough evidence at trial to convict him under Florida law. Juror B29 told Robin Roberts that she favored convicting Zimmerman of second-degree murder when deliberations began by the six-member, all-women jury. &#8220;I was the juror that was going to give them a hung jury,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I fought to the end.&#8221; But by the second day of deliberating, she realized there wasn&#8217;t enough proof to convict the 29-year-old neighborhood watch volunteer of a crime. &#8220;George Zimmerman got away with murder, but you can&#8217;t get away from God,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And at the end of the day, he&#8217;s going to have a lot of questions and answers he has to deal with.&#8221; Zimmerman was acquitted earlier this month of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges in the 2012 slaying of the unarmed 17-year-old. The Miami teenager was shot and killed during a confrontation with Zimmerman in Sanford. The case spawned heated national debates about racial profiling and the so-called Stand Your Ground self-defense laws in Florida and other states. Zimmerman was seen publicly for the first time last week when he assisted a family after their SUV flipped over on a Florida highway. Juror B29 is the second panelist to go public with what went on during deliberations earlier this month. She allowed her face to be shown and used her first name, Maddy, unlike Juror B37, who was interviewed on CNN last week with her face obscured. Four jurors, not including the one interviewed by ABC, issued a statement last week saying the opinions expressed by Juror B37 to CNN&#8217;s Anderson Cooper did not represent their views. That juror said the actions of Zimmerman and Martin both led to the teenager&#8217;s fatal shooting, but that Zimmerman didn&#8217;t actually break the law. Juror B29 also told ABC that she didn&#8217;t believe race was an issue at the trial. Though the judge so far has refused to release the names or biographical information about the jurors, B29 said she was 36 years old and Puerto Rican. Martin was black and Zimmerman identifies himself as Hispanic. Martin&#8217;s parents believe Zimmerman racially profiled their son when he started following him after spotting him walking through the neighborhood where Zimmerman lived and Martin was visiting. B29 said she couldn&#8217;t speak for her fellow jurors on the race issue. The other women on the jury were white. Juror B29 is a nursing assistant and mother of eight children who recently moved to Florida from Chicago. She said she feels like she owes Martin&#8217;s parents an apology. &#8220;I felt like I let a lot of people down, and I&#8217;m thinking to myself, `Did I go the right way? Did I go the wrong way?&#8221;&#8216; she said. &#8220;As much as we were trying to find this man guilty &#8230; They give you a booklet that basically tells you the truth, and the truth is that there was nothing that we could do about it.&#8221; Watch the interview on ABCGuestEmily Bazelon, legal affairs editor for Slate magazine and senior research fellow at Yale Law School.

1008	Author and religious scholar Reza Aslan is one of those people who's at NPR West so often that he blurs the line between guest and employee. We always joke with our regulars that they should have a punch card, and when it's full, they get their own cubicle. Recently, Aslan has been in and out of our studios a lot to talk about his new book, a biography called Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth. Aslan's focus for this biography was of Jesus Christ, the man. "Whatever else he was, whether he was the messiah, or God, or what have you, he was a man. He was a human being," Aslan told Weekend Edition Sunday Host Rachel Martin. For the book, Aslan took the details that are known about the time of Jesus, first century Palestine, a time period that was well documented by the Romans and filled in the details of his life from the sacred history of the Gospels. "But I also recognize as a historian that this is sacred history. ... They are valuable in the sense that they reveal certain truths to us, but that the facts that they reveal are not as valuable as the truths are." To hear more about Aslan's history of Jesus of Nazareth, you can listen to the Weekend Edition Sunday interview: Or a deeper dive on Fresh Air: While it's a no-brainer to us NPR West-ers that Aslan 'hearts' NPR, and while I've had any number of opportunities to ask him to pose for us, it was on this particular day that he was dressed for the occasion.

1008	History repeats itself in Britain: Another piece of art by the mysterious graffiti artist Banksy has been cut out of a wall in the London Borough of Haringey and is expected to fetch hundreds of thousands at an auction. As The Independent reports, the last time, the Sincura Group sold a piece of art called Slave Labour for 750,000 pounds. But that was not without controversy. As we reported, the auction touched off an uproar with Banksy and the community complaining that the art work should stay where it was painted. What's more, it was a mystery how the auction house had acquired the art work: Was it the artist or owner of the building that was benefiting? This time around, reports the Haringey Independent, the auction house says the proceeds will go to charity. The art work in question is features two kids looking up a sign that reads "No Ball Games." The paper reports that, again, residents are not happy: "Taslima Khatoon, of the Tottenham Art Group, said that while it is sad that mural has been taken, at least the money will be going to a good cause. "She said: 'Street art is there for the community to appreciate, enjoy and look after. "'I know the community is very upset and the situation with the Wood Green Banksy will only make this worse. "'The only positive thing we can take away is that the money will go towards a good cause.'" The BBC has more from the auction house: "The group's director Tony Baxter said he had been approached and asked if he could manage the sale of No Ball Games. "He declined to say who approached him. He said the piece, one of Banksy's largest, had to be removed in three pieces. "The last section featuring a girl will be removed later, he said."  [Copyright 2013 NPR]

1008	Last week, a group of young people who'd been deported to Mexico made a big show of their ultimately futile attempt to re-enter the United States. They were pushing for legislation nicknamed the DREAM Act, which would grant a pathway to citizenship for undocumented young people who were brought to the United States when they were very young. But Steve King, a longtime Republican representative from Iowa and an outspoken opponent of immigration reform, wasn't having it. They will say to me and others who defend the rule of law, 'We have to do something about the 11 million. Some of them are valedictorians.' Well, my answer to that is ... it's true in some cases, but they weren't all valedictorians, they weren't all brought in by their parents. For everyone who's a valedictorian, there's another hundred out there, they weigh 130 pounds and they've got calves the size of cantaloupes because they're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert. Those people would be legalized with the same act. As you might have guessed, that didn't really go over too well. John Boehner, the speaker of the House, rebuked his fellow Republican's comments. "There's no place in this debate for hateful or ignorant comments from elected officials," Boehner said earlier this week. Some young immigrant advocates delivered bags full of cantaloupes in front of King's office in mocking protest. Even Raul Labrador, an Idaho representative who's a conservative's conservative, blasted King this week, calling his comments "reprehensible" and referring to King as a "wing nut." (No statement from the NFL yet, but presumably, scouts are salivating over this new crop of freakishly muscled running back prospects pouring over the border.) As my colleague Frank James wrote, King's comments come at an inconvenient time for Republicans, who were badly beaten by Democrats among Latino voters in last fall's elections even as Latinos become an increasingly significant part of the electorate. (According to polls, immigration matters less to Latino voters than the economy and education, but many people see immigration as a kind of litmus test for the way a candidate feels about Latinos.) The party had been trying to repair that breach before King's, er, impolitic comments. But where other politicians might walk back comments like this, King only doubled down. "Eighty [percent] to 90 percent of the illegal drugs consumed in America come from or through Mexico," he said the next day. "I can tell you that in Mexico they are recruiting kids to be drug smugglers, between the ages of 11 and 18." And in the grand Washington tradition, King's re-election campaign sent out an email to supporters referencing the hullabaloo and asking for donations to fight "the pro-amnesty crowd [that's] out in full force against me." The email went on: The left will use these made up headlines in TV and radio commercials to influence the voters of Iowa's 4th District to vote against me. Without my own war chest, I won't be able to defend myself and set the record straight with Iowans. Can I count on you to contribute $25, $50, $100 or more to my campaign to help fend off these attacks? If every one of you who receive this email were to just give $15 today, we would raise enough money to pay for television ads on every Des Moines network station for this entire election cycle – and the left will be hard pressed to fight back. Say what you will about the guy and his history of, er, impolitic comments — that Hillary Clinton has close ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, calling for Muslims to be racially profiled at airports, seemingly comparing immigrants to dogs on Univision — he's more than willing to own what he says. King is hardly the first politician to make racially inflammatory statements. And there's an argument to be made that King's comments have some value; there are countless Americans who agree with King, and having his ideas in a public space gives the country an opportunity to grapple with them. (Conversely, granting legitimacy to comments like King's expands the universe of acceptable discourse.) But the current media environment means that someone like King, a relative backbencher, can get airtime and attention that far outstrips his actual political influence. That means King has a smaller margin of error from ignominy — he can't make public statements anywhere that won't end up on YouTube or tweeted out to the wider world. And given the challenge the GOP faces in winning Latino converts, his party has a smaller margin for error, too. [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
1008	Barnaby Jack, one of the world's most prominent hackers, died on Friday, the San Francisco Medical Examiner tells NPR's Steve Henn. As Steve tells our Newscast unit, Jack became a hacker hero when he exploited a security vulnerability in an ATM machine and made it spit out cash. The move became known as "Jackpotting." Via YouTube, here is the moment from the Black Hat USA 2010 conference (the real action starts at 3:05 and 5:57): Jack was 36. As Bloomberg reports, Jack did not stop at ATMs. Last year, he found a security flaw in an insulin pump that allowed him to send a command from 300 feet away that would deliver a deathly dose. Next week, Jack planned to show off his latest hack at the Blackhat conference: He was going to show how he could hack into a pacemaker or defibrillator and short it out, presumably killing a person. Jack told Vice Magazine that he was intrigued by the devices when he found out they were capable of communicating wirelessly. "I decided to look at pacemakers and ICDs (implantable cardioverter defibrillators) to see if they communicated securely and if it would be possible for an attacker to remotely control these devices," he said. After about six months, he found a vulnerability and was able to control the device. Steve Henn reminds us that Jack was one of the good guys. He found the vulnerabilities and told manufacturers about them. Jack worked at the security firm IOActive. "Lost but never forgotten our beloved pirate, Barnaby Jack has passed," IO said on Twitter. "He was a master hacker and dear friend. Here's to you Barnes!" His cause of death is still unknown. [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
1008	Don't try to pretend your gibes and judgments of the overweight people in your life are for their own good. Florida researchers have evidence that discriminating against fat people only makes them fatter. "People often rationalize that it's OK to discriminate based on weight because it will motivate the victim to lose pounds," Angelina Sutin, a psychologist at the Florida State College of Medicine in Tallahassee, tells Shots. "But our findings suggest the opposite." Sutin and a colleague checked survey data from more than 6,000 American men and women age 50 and older who were asked how often in their daily lives they experienced different types of discrimination. Examples ranged from discourtesy or refusal of restaurant service to not getting a job or promotion. The survey then asked the respondents why they thought the discrimination happened. Was it was because of their race or age, for example, or their sex, age or weight? Researchers also measured the participants' weight and height. Four years later, a follow-up survey asked the same questions and checked for changes in weight. Overweight people who said they'd experienced discrimination based on weight were more than twice as likely to be obese four years later than people who didn't mention such discrimination. And those who started out obese were three times more likely to remain so if they'd been harshly targeted because of their weight. Other types of discrimination showed no effect on weight. Sutin's study, published in the latest issue of the online journal PLOS One, wasn't designed to get at why weight discrimination led many fat people to pack on even more pounds. But other research suggests that increased rates of depression, emotional eating and low-self esteem likely play a role. So does increased stress (and the associated hormonal surges that can trigger even more hunger and eating), as well as the avoidance of exercise. "If someone's mean to you at the gym because of your weight or acts like you don't belong there," Sutin says, "you're less likely to go back." The roots of obesity are complex and include genetics and other factors that go well beyond individual choice. "Trying to promote healthy behaviors is a good thing," she says, but shaming someone has no place in the solution. Unfortunately, weight-related prejudice and discrimination persists in many spheres and is only increasing among employers, teachers — and doctors. [Copyright 2013 NPR]

Now they make their first appearance on Mountain Stage, recorded live on the campus of West Virginia University in Morgantown. Ramirez studied music at Douglas Anderson School of the Arts in his native Florida, while Sudano spent much of her young life touring the world as a backing singer for her mother, the late disco queen Donna Summer. Their 2012 album Home, Vol. 1, an amalgam of soul, folk, pop and blues, has been compared to work by superstars like Lauryn Hill and John Mayer.

1008	Anthony Weiner and Eliot Spitzer have been very good to the New York tabloids. First, they delivered lurid scandals for cheeky newspaper headline writers to work with. That's like rocket fuel for the tabs, which thrive on conflict and scandal and aren't nearly as cautious and measured as the broadsheets. Then, after resigning from office — Weiner from Congress, Spitzer from the governorship — each decided to make an against-all-odds return to elected politics this year. On Tuesday, the pun-loving tabs got even luckier: Weiner admitted that his lewd message exchanges with other women — the behavior that led to his 2011 resignation from the House — had, in fact, continued more than a year after his initial confession. Here's a quick recap of the rough treatment Weiner and Spitzer have received, courtesy of two of the best-known tabloids, the New York Daily News and the New York Post: In the beginning, there was Spitzer. The ex-governor resigned in March 2008 after The New York Times reported that Spitzer had been a client of an escort service. The day after the revelation, the tabs were off and running. Three years later, it was Weiner who got embroiled in a sensational sex scandal. Naturally, given his unique surname, the puns were over the top — and gleefully juvenile. Weiner initially sought to hold on to his job, even after more women came forward. The Post wasn't helping his cause: It tagged any content related to the scandal as "Battle of the Bulge," signaling the paper's snickering approach. Weiner's return to the arena in April, when he began hinting at a run for mayor, only revved up the sexually suggestive headlines. As if that wasn't enough, more manna from heaven: Earlier this month, the disgraced Spitzer suddenly announced a run for New York City comptroller, giving the tabs another chance to pile on. Then came the latest revelations in the Weiner scandal: more sexting than the ex-congressman had previously acknowledged, followed by a dramatic press conference. The ex-congressman's porn star-like online nickname — Carlos Danger — proved irresistible. The tabs' fun won't end there. The Democratic primary for both offices isn't until Sept. 10.

1008	The world has changed a lot since a divorced mother of two teamed up with a St. Louis gynecologist to study the physiology of sex. Masters and Johnson's first book, Human Sexual Response, made Virginia Johnson and William Masters household names in the 1960s. More than any other scientists before them, they approached sex as a biological process to be observed, measured and analyzed. Virginia Masters died this week at age 88. Her work is credited with dispelling many long-held myths about sex, from the thought that penis size matters to the notion that old people don't do it. "We've gone through tremendous change," says Eli Coleman, director of the program in human sexuality at the University of Minnesota. He says he remembers when Masters and Johnson couldn't get their work published in medical journals. "That just isn't the case any more," Coleman told Shots. "Masters and Johnson were pioneers, and they legitimized the field. We're seeing the results of their courage and labor." But research on sex can still be a tough sell, even in an age when Internet porn has made it possible for people to view every imaginable form of sexual conduct. Research projects that have the word "sex" somewhere in them continue to run into trouble with critics in Congress and advocacy groups. They include a project at the University of Minnesota funded by the National Institutes of Health that was designed to reduce the risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases for homosexual men who looked for sexual partners on the Internet. The Traditional Values Coalition called that a "government-funded gay porn site." "Did you know that your paycheck was hit in order to fund a study on how to use condoms correctly?" Fox News pundit Sean Hannity asked this spring. He was talking about a $423,500 study at the Indiana University's Kinsey Institute for Sex, Gender, and Reproduction on barriers to condom use. Hannity claimed the project, which got federal stimulus funding, failed to create jobs. The university says that in fact about nine researchers were employed for three years, and the research is studying how to increase proper condom use to reduce STDs and pregnancy. "Sex is still a very volatile subject," says Jennifer Bass, director of communications for the Kinsey Institute. "The questions we had 50 years ago are different, but some of those questions still remain. Why do people do what they do even though they know about the consequences? Why do smart people get involved in dangerous situations? How does sex influence people's lives and choices?" With the NIH research budget shrinking, scientists who study sex will find the hunt for funds no easier. "But I think there is a lot of support of basic science research in the area of sexuality," Coleman says — at least from other scientists. [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
1008	Hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors has pleaded not guilty to wire and securities fraud, a day after federal prosecutors in New York charged the firm in connection with an alleged insider trading scheme. Peter Nussbaum, SAC's general counsel, entered the plea on behalf of the firm, one of Wall Street's biggest hedge funds. Assistant U.S. Attorney Antonia Apps told a federal judge in Manhattan that "voluminous" evidence, including "electronic messages, instant messages, court-ordered wiretaps and consensual recordings" existed to prove that SAC Capital knowingly participated in insider trading over a 10-year period. SAC's owner, billionaire Steven Cohen, is already the subject of a civil case by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to two portfolio managers, Mathew Martoma and Michael Steinberg, who prosecutors say were allowed to execute trades based on insider knowledge. As NPR's Elise Hu reported Thursday, Cohen says he didn't see a key, incriminating email because he gets too many messages. The firm issued a statement earlier this week saying it "has never encouraged, promoted or tolerated insider trading and takes its compliance and management obligations seriously." In March, SAC affiliates agreed to pay more than $600 million in penalties related to charges that they participated in an insider trading scheme involving a clinical trial for a new Alzheimer's drug.

1008	Maybe the Democrat who hopes to unseat Sen. Mitch McConnell is ready for prime time after all. That's one way to view the highly polished Web video in which Alison Lundergan Grimes, Kentucky's secretary of state, appears, employing humor, pathos, earnestness and her grandmothers to skewer the leader of the Senate Republicans. The ad cleverly throws down the gauntlet to McConnell's campaign, which in a somewhat unusual video of a few weeks ago had an AutoTuned singer ask and answer the question: "What rhymes with Alison Lundergan Grimes? Not ready for prime time." (Spoiler alert: Grimes' ad asks the question: What rhymes with Mitch?" And the way it gets there is worth the journey.) The new Grimes video, which announces that she will have a grand rollout of her campaign on Tuesday, is something of a do-over after a very rough entry into the race in early July. When Grimes announced a few weeks ago that she would make the U.S. Senate race against McConnell, his campaign — and neutral observers — generally observed that her candidacy seemed prematurely born, to say the least. There was a slapdash quality to her launch, whether it was the banner from her secretary of state campaign as a backdrop or a website that essentially was a watch-this-space placeholder. For a campaign striving to be taken seriously as a threat to a canny and formidable incumbent like McConnell, it was an unorthodox approach, to put it mildly. It seemed to give credence to the McConnell campaign's contention that she wasn't ready for the national political stage and certainly not ready to contend with the likes of a five-term senator. But if the video is any indication of what's to come, and if McConnell can get past a primary bid from Matt Bevin, a Tea Party-oriented challenger, the general election campaign could turn out to look a lot less like a contest between the University of Louisville and, say, Transylvania University basketball teams than a race where the challenger has a real chance at an upset. McConnell, a shrewd political veteran with great money-raising chops, still holds a substantial edge. A recent survey by Wenzel Strategies, a Republican pollster, showed the senator with substantial leads over Grimes and Bevin. McConnell held about an 8-percentage-point lead over Grimes and a nearly 40-point lead over Bevin.  [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
1008	The voting is finished. The taste test is done. The verdict is in: Marti Olesen has won All Things Considered's Taste of Summer contest with her recipe for Diane's Dad's Summer Sandwich. I know not everybody will agree with my decision. Frankly, in my book, all three finalists are winners. Judging them was tricky business because so often it was like comparing apples, oranges and kumquats. Each story had its own merits. Each recipe was good and had its vocal supporters. Susan Jones' Strawberry Trifle story was charming and fantastic. That a non-cook's "bring a dish" anxiety was extinguished by serendipity, when a scrap of paper blowing in the wind on recycling day caught her attention, is appealing for anyone who's struggled in the kitchen. Patricia Mulvey's story was about how her Ensenada Slaw came out of a crazy trip from hell to Mexico. I think "Maximo's Auto Repair and Beauty Supply Shop" will be burned in my brain for the rest of my life. Screwball comedy — when it happens off-screen — is also very, very appealing, and Pat is an expressive storyteller, for sure. But Marti Olesen's story was stealthy. On the surface, it was simple: She hears about a recipe with ingredients that seem odd together, she tries it, she doesn't like it. But then she learns the secret: It's in the layering. She tries it again and loves it so much she plants a garden to better enjoy this summer sandwich. Her dedication to this thing that didn't seem like it would taste all that good is also appealing. At our NPR headquarters, I made each recipe for a Taste of Summer taste test. They were all easy to do, included seasonal ingredients and earned a summer cook's vote of gratitude for not requiring an oven or a stove top. But here's one thing that gave the summer sandwich an edge: It has high shareability, in that it's a recipe people really, really want to share. Over and over, pro-sandwich listeners wrote in along these lines: "I couldn't believe this sandwich, with its white cheddar cheese, tomato, cucumber, onion and crunchy peanut butter combo, could possibly be that good. So I made it. I loved it. I loved it so much I made another. I made my kids try it. They loved it. I cannot wait to make it again." This high shareability quotient was driven home during our taste test. While not everybody sampling was Team Sandwich, everybody who was Team Sandwich was emphatically and surprisingly Team Sandwich, and their enthusiasm was infectious. You could practically hear the buzz around the table as people not involved with the taste test were pulled in to try the sandwich. As engineer Stu Rushfield, who'd heard all the Taste of Summer stories, put it: "I wouldn't say no to any of these recipes. But the one I'd make again is the sandwich. Because it's just so strange. And so good." Thanks to everyone who participated in our contest. It was a lot of fun. I'm off to make another sandwich now. The crunchy peanut butter really does make it. Melissa Gray is the producer of All Things Considered's Found Recipes series. [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
1008	In the latest in a string of insider trading cases, federal prosecutors this week indicted SAC Capital, one of the most prominent and profitable hedge funds in the world. But when it comes to the 2008 financial crisis that sent the economy into a tailspin, criminal prosecutions have been few and far between. "The folks responsible for this incredibly painful economic damage that struck our economy have gone free," says Neil Barofsky, a former federal prosecutor who also served as special inspector general overseeing the big Troubled Asset Relief Program bank bailout, signed into law by President Bush in 2008. Insider trading prosecutions have resulted in more than 70 convictions so far. "This sends a very, very powerful message to the entire industry," Barofsky says. So why haven't any high-profile bankers gone to jail for selling all those trash mortgages and helping to wreck the economy? "People ask me about it all the time and I try to give the best explanation I have as being inside of the system," says Barofsky, who notes that when the financial crisis hit, white-collar crime investigators already had their hands full with expanding insider trading investigations. But the government should have thrown a lot more investigators at the financial crisis, he says. William Black, a top lawyer for the Office of Thrift Supervision during the savings and loan debacle in the 1980s, agrees. "I've been saying it for years," he says. "You have to make the effort." He notes that during the savings and loan crisis, he was involved with a lot of criminal prosecutions. "At peak we had a thousand FBI agents working those cases." By comparison, Black says, when the financial crisis hit there were only 120 FBI agents working on bank fraud. And mortgage fraud cases against big financial firms are just tough cases to bring, Black says. "Insider trading is a much more understandable case for a jury, typically," he says. It's pretty simple: Somebody gets access to confidential information — say a drug trial was going badly. So they use that secret information to cheat and make a lot of money in the stock market. The financial crisis was more complicated. It involved mortgage securitizations and sophisticated investment instruments. "It would be much more difficult than the insider trading cases," says Black. After the financial crisis, the government lost a case involving Bear Stearns, the global investment bank that failed in 2008 before being sold to JPMorgan Chase. Maybe that didn't help. Also, back then the government wanted to save the banks. So maybe launching a full-scale prosecutorial assault didn't seem like the best idea. Barofsky says narratives also tend to take hold in Washington. And for the 2008 financial crisis, it's this: A lot of people on Wall Street were wrong, they made mistakes, they were greedy, but they didn't commit actual crimes. You could hear that when Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, spoke to CNBC host Jim Cramer last week. Dimon: "I think if someone did something wrong, they should go to jail." Cramer: "Well who did? Who went to jail?" Dimon: "One of the great things about America is, failure is not illegal or wrong. ... You make investments. They don't always pay off. It doesn't mean you're a criminal." Barofsky says this explanation appears to have taken root quite strongly in Washington. "That's the justification to explain the lack of cases," says Barofsky, who adds that he doesn't agree with it. "I think that there was a tremendous amount of fraud." For his part, Black says, it's not too late to prosecute financial firms that may have been involved in wrongdoing. He says scores of private civil lawsuits have uncovered evidence. Those could provide a road map for criminal prosecution. [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
1008	Typically, police arrive at the scene of a crime after it occurs. But rather than send cops to yesterday's crime, a new trend in law enforcement is using computers to predict where tomorrow's crimes will be — and then try to head them off. The software uses past statistics to project where crime is moving. Police in Los Angeles say it's worked well in predicting property crimes there. Now Seattle is about to expand it for use in predicting gun violence. It all started as a research project. Jeff Brantingham, an anthropologist at UCLA, wanted to see if computers could model future crime the same way they model earthquake aftershocks. Turns out they can. "It predicts sort of twice as much crime as any other existing system, even going head-to-head with a crime analyst," Brantingham says. Checking The Boxes Older systems, like the famous CompStat in New York, show where crime has been. This system looks forward. "The model will actually predict other locations, that effectively say, even though there was a crime somewhere else in your environment, the risk is still greatest in this location today for the next 10 hours or the next 12 hours," Brantingham explains. Brantingham and his colleagues are now selling the predictive system to police departments with the name PredPol. At this point, you may be thinking about the sci-fi movie Minority Report. But this is different. No psychics sleeping in bathtubs, for one. More to the point, this doesn't predict who will commit a future crime, just where it is likely to happen. In Seattle, police Sgt. Christi Robbin zooms in on a map of the city. Earlier this year, Seattle started using PredPol to predict property crimes. It's now the first place to try predicting gun violence with the software. "These red boxes [on the map] are predictions of where the next crimes are likely to occur," Robbin explains. At the start of every shift, patrol cops are assigned to those red boxes. "So we're asking that they spent the time in that 500-by-500-square-foot box, doing whatever proactive work they can to prevent that crime," Robbin says. On a recent shift, officer Philip Monzon pulls up inside his box; today, it's a city block near the Seattle waterfront. "[The police] want visibility, they want contacts with businesses as are appropriate, and anyone who's wandering through the area," Monzon explains. This area has parking lots, and PredPol's forecast includes car thefts. As Monzon passes a green Honda, he pauses. The guy inside seems to be ducking under the dashboard. "[I] wanna make sure to see if he's got the key or if he's gonna pull out anytime soon," Monzon says. The car starts — the guy probably does have the key. But why didn't Monzon challenge him, just in case? "I don't really have enough — I'm not just going to single out one guy in a Honda," he explains. Computer Models And 'Reasonable Suspicion' And this is where this gets tricky. The courts say police need "reasonable suspicion" in order to stop somebody. That suspicion can come from a lot of things — even someone's "furtive movements," as police like to say. But can it come from the fact that someone is occupying an imaginary red box drawn by a computer? "Ah — no. No. I don't know. I wouldn't make a stop solely on that," Monzon says. That's probably the right answer, says Andrew Guthrie Ferguson, a law professor at the University of the District of Columbia who has taken a special interest in the constitutional implications of PredPol. He says the departments using it have told police not to use it as a basis for stops. But he also wonders how long that can last. "The idea that you wouldn't use something that is actually part of the officer's suspicion and not put that in — [that] may come to a head when that officer is testifying," Ferguson says. Either that officer will have to omit the fact that he or she was prompted by PredPol, he says, or that officer will admit it on the stand. "Then the issue will be raised for the court to address."  And it may be that PredPol is a constitutional basis for stopping someone. Some might consider it more objective than an individual police officer's judgment — less prone to racism or other kinds of profiling, for example. Ferguson says that argument may have merit, but that police and society still need to be careful. "I think most people are gonna defer to the black box," he says. "Which means we need to focus on what's going into that black box, how accurate it is, and what transparency and accountability measures we have [for] it." In other words, even though computers aren't biased, the statistics feeding it might be. And if police are going to follow an algorithm, we should at least be willing to check the math.

1008	John Oliver has brought oracular authority to a three-month fill-in stint on Comedy Central this summer. With Jon Stewart off directing a film, the anchor chair at The Daily Show has been occupied by the show's senior British correspondent, John Oliver, whose own stand-up show on Comedy Central is just beginning its fourth season. Oliver tells NPR's Robert Siegel that being an anchorman is "a pretty weird experience, sitting behind that desk. I knew that I was going to have some almost comically oversized shoes to step into ... I definitely feel like a child wearing a full adult clown pair of shoes." Interview Highlights On this summer's overload of big news stories like Edward Snowden, the George Zimmerman trial, and several Supreme Court decisions "I was definitely prepared for it to be slower, and it has not worked out that way in any shape or form. I'm grateful as a comedian, and slightly demoralized, occasionally, as a human being — those two things are always very different." On his British accent "You're sonically racist, Americans. You think we all sound the same, whereas I have definitely a mongrel accent. My family are from Liverpool, so I have some twang there — I have a Midlands accent, and I was raised about an hour north of London, so my voice is a mess. Although, to American ears, it sounds like the crisp language of a queen's butler." On how stand-up audiences react to his stint as an anchorman "I don't think I'm identified as the anchorman, I think I'm identified as the impostor anchorman — there's a very clear line there ... I don't think it changes the way they respond. I mean, people, I guess, generally come to see me do stand-up with a working knowledge of my broad sense of humor on The Daily Show ... I don't think anyone would mistake me as an actual anchor. I think I'm just a summer fling that people will soon forget." On living in America "I love it here, I deeply love it here. And, you know, I guess the tone of jokes is often, at best, irreverent, but it always comes from a place of deep love. I do not want to leave here ... I cannot make that clear enough to immigration authorities who may be listening to this interview. I don't want to leave, so please don't make me. "I have a green card now, but they can take that away, yeah, they can take that away at any moment. So please don't; please let me keep it." [Copyright 2013 NPR]

1008	More than 10,000 athletes are meeting in Cleveland for The National Senior Games. Adults older than 55 — and some older than 90 — are running track, riding bikes, playing basketball and competing in many of the sports you might see at the Summer Olympics. In fact there are a few who were Olympians themselves back in the day who say they find that competition is just as satisfying in their later years. One of those is 82-year-old swimmer Graham Johnston. When he's not racing or getting ready to race, he's in the stands, checking out the other swimmers with an expert eye. "See," he says, pointing at one competitor, "he took a breath on the turn. Shouldn't have done that." But when it's over, he applauds and shouts "Great race" to all the swimmers. And Johnston knows a great race when he sees one. He's been swimming since the age of 2. "My father was a manager of a swimming pool," he explains. And there wasn't a lot else to do in the small South African town where he grew up. Over the decades, Johnston has set world records in various age groups for older swimmers. He's in several national and international swimming halls of fame. Back in 1952 he represented South Africa in the Olympics. But as an Olympian, he describes himself as an "also-ran." "Unfortunately, when I had to train for the Olympics, I didn't have much money and I couldn't eat very well," Johnston says. "And I probably only had one half-decent meal a day. And I think I had some malnourishment. I never got in the final. I missed the final by one position." Johnston came to the United States on a swimming scholarship from the University of Oklahoma. That's where he met his wife, Janice. It was during their freshman year. Janice says, "He just didn't swim fast enough to get away." She goes to every one of her husband's races. "I love being his cheerleader," she says. Or as her husband puts it: "She's my athletic supporter." Not only is Janice Johnston at all of her husband's races; she's at every practice too. That's five or six trips to the pool each week, every week. Johnston used to train twice a day but hasn't for the past four years. "I find I'm too tired," he says. That regimen began 40 years ago when he discovered Masters Swimming, which organizes competitions for adults. As with the Senior Games in Cleveland, competitors are grouped by age in five-year increments. And more recently, Johnston has taken up open water swimming, making the trip across the Straits of Gibraltar and swimming from the Hawaiian island of Lanai to Maui. There was "a 20-foot tiger shark in Maui one year," says Johnston with bravado, "but it wasn't hungry." Still, he knows that no amount of attitude, competition or rigorous training can defeat the toll of age. "As your body ages, all your physical equipment deteriorates," he says. "I feel a lot older and I'm getting a lot slower, but so is everybody else." He jokes that lot of his competition is already dead. "But I'm still here," he says with a chuckle. Johnston still has living competition, and he joined them in the pool for the 200-meter freestyle. He holds the Senior Games record in this event for his age group. He didn't beat the record, but he beat the guy who came in after him by 41 seconds. So Johnston got another gold medal. But he says medals have never motivated him. In fact, he's given pounds of them away to kids he's coached. He's in it for the camaraderie at the pool, he says, and the thrill of the race. "That's what makes life exciting," he says. "You've got to get that adrenaline high." And that's something that doesn't change for athletes, no matter what their age. [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
1008	U.S. sanctions mean that any citizen or business wanting to buy stuff from North Korea has to send a letter to the U.S. government asking for special permission. A few months back, we submitted a Freedom of Information Act request, asking for those letters. Our request was granted: We recently received a packet of 18 letters from Americans who wanted to do business with the most isolated nation on the planet. We've posted all of the letters online. We also managed to track down some of the people who wrote the letters. Here's what we learned: Stamps Donald Sundman, president of Mystic Stamp Co. in Camden, N.Y., asked for permission to buy postage stamps from North Korea. Some North Korean stamps show pictures of dogs. There's at least one that, weirdly, has a picture of Princess Diana. Another, less weirdly, has a picture of a unified Korean peninsula. Sundman told me he wanted to get the stamps because, basically, they're hard to get — which makes them appealing for some collectors. This is one theme in the requests to do business with North Korea: People don't want North Korean stuff because it's cheap or well-made; people want the stuff because it's hard to get. They want special permission to buy stuff because the sanctions make it hard to buy stuff. Jeans Patrick Forster, CFO of a Coca-Cola bottling plant in Tennessee, asked for permission to buy a pair of $220 jeans that were made in North Korea. He told me he thought they'd make a nice birthday present for his wife, whose father escaped from North Korea during the war. The government granted his request. "She's only worn them one time," he said. "They didn't fit quite right." The jeans are called NoKo jeans, and they're the brainchild of a few young Swedish guys who, on a whim, managed to get 1,100 pairs of jeans made in North Korea — despite the fact that jeans are seen as a symbol of imperialism in the country. "We didn't use the word 'jeans' during the production," Tor Kallstigen told me. "The company was called Pants Provided." Beer One guy wanted to import North Korean beer. I couldn't track him down, but I did find a guy who had tasted it. Josh Thomas, a graphic designer in Hong Kong, told me it tastes just like Anchor Steam. He said North Korea bought a brewery in the U.K. and brought it over to North Korea. I don't know whether the request to import North Korean beer was granted, but I've never seen North Korean beer in this country. Thomas says he tried to bring some back to Hong Kong with him. The bottles weren't very well-made, and when the barometric pressure dropped, they burst. For More: Listen to our show, The North Korea Files. [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
1008	David Niven's been dead for 30 years, so he can't be behind this: "A Bosnian from the 'Pink Panther' gang of international jewel thieves escaped from a Swiss prison in a dramatic break-out involving a fellow inmate and two armed accomplices, police said Friday." (Agence France-Presse, via GlobalPost) According to AFP, "Milan Poparic, who was serving a sentence of almost seven years for a 2009 robbery at a jewelery store, is the third 'Pink Panther' to escape from a Swiss prison since May." As you might expect, Friday's escape reportedly involved a van that rammed through a gate, ladders that were used to get above barbed wire and gunfire from automatic weapons. No one was hurt, AFP says. This gang earned the "Pink Panther" nickname because they once hid a diamond ring in a jar of face cream — just like the crooks did in one of the Pink Panther movies. As The New Yorker has written about the modern-day gang: "All told, the Panthers have performed hundreds of robberies all over the world. The gang's cinematic name is an invention of the press: the police, after raiding one thief's apartment, found a blue-diamond ring, worth seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars, hidden inside a jar of face cream; a similar hiding place was used in one of the Peter Sellers films." Oh, and about that David Niven reference. Here's how IMDB.com begins its synopsis of the plot of 1963's The Pink Panther: "As a child, Princess Dala receives a gift from her father, the Shah of Lugash: the Pink Panther, the largest diamond in the world. This huge pink gem has an unusual flaw: looking deeply into the stone, one perceives a tiny discoloration resembling a leaping pink panther hence the name. As the camera moves in, this image comes to life and participates in the credits. When Dala is a young woman, rebels seize power in Lugash and then demand possession of the jewel, but the exiled princess refuses to hand it over. "Dala (Claudia Cardinale) relaxes on holiday at an exclusive skiing resort in Cortina d'Ampezzo, where noted British playboy Sir Charles Lytton (David Niven), who leads a secret life as a jewel thief called 'The Phantom,' has his eyes on the Pink Panther. His American playboy nephew, George (Robert Wagner), follows his uncle to the resort hoping to steal the jewel and blame it on the Phantom, not realizing that the Phantom is his uncle." Peter Sellers, the original Inspector Clouseau in the movies, died in 1980. Herbert Lom, who played the exasperated police chief Dreyfus, died in 2012. The movies' director, Blake Edwards, died in 2010. [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
1008	"Genocide in Indonesia." Those words probably don't make you want to rush out to see a new movie. But what if we add these: Genocide in Indonesia, with gangsters, cowboys, dancing girls, men in drag and splashy musical numbers. They're all part of the year's strangest documentary, The Act of Killing. The opening looks like something from a demented Bollywood musical. Costumed girls come dancing out of the mouth of a giant fish, frolicking under a waterfall as a director barks at them to look happy, happier. Standing with them, also getting soaked, are two men, one slender and dressed as a priest, the other fat, in a turquoise satin gown. These two are notorious Indonesian death-squad leaders — men who slaughtered countless civilians they accused of being communists after a military takeover in 1965. And they are not shy in talking about what they've done. But the filmmakers didn't want a talking-heads documentary, so they offered them a different option: re-enact their stories in whatever cinematic style they like. They like mob movies, and musicals. And this bizarre scene is part of one such re-enactment. The slender man in black is executioner Anwar Congo. The heavyset man gowned in turquoise is paramilitary leader Herman Koto, who is not only enthusiastic about dressing like Carmen Miranda, but also eager to recruit extras for the film's retellings of horrifying events. He holds auditions in the street, urging people too young to have been alive during the actual atrocities to scream as if their families are being killed. A crowd has gathered and applauds. Filmmaker Joshua Oppenheimer is obviously treading on dicey moral ground here, empowering killers to tell their story when they've never been called to account for the barbarism that brought them to power. By some estimates, more than 1.2 million civilians were slaughtered in these Indonesian upheavals, which makes it somewhat unnerving when these men say that films inspired them in their sadism. They picked up strangulation techniques, for instance, from gangster flicks. Congo, playing a victim at one point, has just such a technique used on him, to his quite evident distress. But in public he shows no doubts, even appearing on TV, where a telegenic interviewer congratulates him for having found an efficient, humane way of killing communists. Back in the TV control room, a producer wonders how these guys can sleep. As will you once they've restaged their killings for Oppenheimer's cameras, sometimes in stylized ways, other times with a realism so wrenching the extras are left almost catatonic in a scene's wake. Play-acting with murderers. Not sure I'd want that on my resume — and with easily two-thirds of the performers and technicians listed in the end credits as "anonymous," it's clear many of the crew found the idea disquieting, too. But there's a reason that two great documentary filmmakers — Werner Herzog and Errol Morris — signed on to produce The Act of Killing. It's a virtually unprecedented social document. Time after time, Oppenheimer highlights jaw-dropping disconnects — killers proud of the fact that they simply made up the charges for which they executed people; thugs comforting children who've been told to cry for a scene, but then can't stop; a strangulation scene interrupted by the call to evening prayers; gangsters laughing about the 14-year-olds they raped. But the disconnects aren't the whole film. For in having these monsters re-create their atrocities for the camera, a space has been opened ... for feeling. And the filmmakers show you what may be the first consequence of opening that space, as one man is hit, almost physically, by the reality of what he has done, and then walks out of the scene without a word. The Act of Killing, which may leave you speechless too, is one of the most arresting acts of cinema around. (Recommended) [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
1008	Army Pfc. Bradley Manning was not aiding the enemy when he leaked the largest cache of classified information in the history of the United States, the defense argued today during closing arguments of his military trial in Fort Meade, Maryland, today. Instead, he released the information in an attempt to spark debate about things he found troubling about war and American diplomacy. CBS News reports that Manning's civilian defense attorney David Coombs said Manning is a whistleblower not a traitor. CBS reports: "Coombs said the prosecution cherry-picked Manning's chats with convicted computer hacker Adrian Lamo to make their case. He urged the judge to read the entire chat log to put things in context. "For example, he said the prosecution cited a line Manning wrote to Lamo: 'If you had unprecedented access to classified networks, 14 hours a day, seven days a week, for eight-plus months, what would you do?' "Coombs pointed out Manning also wrote, 'Hypothetical question: If you had free reign over classified networks over a long period of time, if you saw incredible things, awful things, things that belonged in the public domain and not on some server stored in a dark room in Washington, D.C., what would you do?'" As we've told you before: Manning has already admitted that he gave classified information to WikiLeaks. But he has denied the most serious charge he's faced with: aiding the enemy, a charge punishable by life in prison. At issue in this case is whether Manning knowingly provided intelligence to enemies of the U.S. During their more than five-hour closing arguments yesterday, prosecutors argued Manning was reckless and that he released information to WikiLeaks — instead of traditional news outlets — because he wanted the data to be available in an indiscriminate manner. The closing arguments are still ongoing. We'll update this post with more a little later on. Manning's fate will be decided by Army Col. Denise Lind, a military judge. Manning requested a judge decide his case instead of a jury. Update at 8:57 p.m. ET. Case In Judge's Hand:  Bradley Manning's fate is now in the hands of Army Col. Denise Lind, the military judge presiding over the case.  "Lind will deliberate over the weekend and will give a day's notice ahead of her verdict," ABC News reports. "Once a verdict is announced the sentencing phase of the court martial is scheduled to begin next Wednesday." [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
1008	At the request of Egypt's army chief, Gen. Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, many Egyptians took to the street Friday to give him a mandate for what he calls a "war against terrorism" on Islamists. His call drew a huge response from those opposed to Mohammed Morsi, but it also brought out large numbers of supporters of the ousted president who is allied with the Muslim Brotherhood. As the following photographs show, anti-Morsi protesters rallied in Cairo's Tahrir Square ... ... while those allied with Morsi gathered near the Rabaa al-Adawiya mosque. [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
1008	Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former head of the International Monetary Fund who was forced to resign amid allegations of sexual misconduct in the U.S., faces charges of "aggravated pimping" before a court in his native France. A trial date has not been set. Strauss-Kahn, 64, stepped down as head of the IMF in 2011 after he was accused of sexually assaulting a New York hotel maid. Although those charges were later dropped, they derailed the politician's plans to run for the French presidency. In 2012, prosecutors accused Strauss-Kahn of involvement in a prostitution ring in the northern city of Lille. On Friday, authorities said they would go ahead with formal charges in the case. The Associated Press, quoting judicial officials, says that prostitutes questioned in the case said they had sex with Strauss-Kahn in 2010 and 2011 in France and also in Washington, D.C., where he lived while working at the IMF. In France, it is not against the law to pay for sex and, as Reuters reports, "pimping is a broad crime that encompasses aiding or encouraging prostitution." However, the news agency says, "Because the parties allegedly involved several prostitutes, Strauss-Kahn will stand trial in Lille on the more serious charge of aggravated pimping, which carries a maximum term of 10 years in prison and a $2 million fine." Strauss-Kahn, who has maintained that he has been unfairly targeted because of his lavish lifestyle, has acknowledged attending sex parties but says he was not aware the women were being paid for their services.

1008	It seems like the Midwest is a hotbed for medical mysteries these days. Earlier this week, scientists traced a brand-new virus to ticks in Missouri. Now disease detectives are hot on the trail of another puzzling pathogen in the heartland. A stomach bug has sickened at least 321 people across 14 states, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. The source of the outbreak is still unknown, though the parasite that's causing the outbreak, cyclospora, is usually found in food. About 90 percent of the cases have been reported in Iowa, Texas and Nebraska. But the bug has also cropped up in the Southeast and New England. Health officials say they still don't know how cyclospora is making it into people's meals. Most of us aren't familiar with cyclospora, and that's a good thing. The parasite, which likes to hang out on fresh fruits and vegetables, causes a rather nasty bout of diarrhea that can last weeks. "It's a tenacious critter," Dr. William Schaffner from Vanderbilt University told CBS News Thursday. "It can produce a prolonged, watery, very uncomfortable diarrhea." And the bug doesn't stop there. "What's unique to this parasite is that it causes anorexia," or lack of appetite, says Ynes Ortega, from the University of Georgia's Food Safety Center. "People lose a lot of weight, very fast." "I have a friend who got the disease, and she said it was like being pregnant at first," Ortega told Shots. "Even the sight or smell of food makes you nauseous." It's not the worst parasite out there, Ortega says. But it can put you in the hospital if you have a weakened immune system or another underlying illness. At least 18 people have been hospitalized in the current outbreak. The good news, Ortega says, is that the treatment for cyclospora is fast and effective. Sulfa drugs wipe out the infection quickly. Cyclospora is relatively rare in the U.S. Most food poisonings here are caused by bacteria or viruses, like E. coli and norovirus. In contrast, cyclospora is a protozoan, which typically hangs out in tropical and subtropical regions. "We never realized that this parasite would come into the developed world," Ortega says. "Travelers would get it when they ate contaminated fruits and vegetables in communities with poor sanitation." But since the U.S. started importing more of its produce, cyclospora has been tagging along. The first large outbreak occurred in 1996 and affected about 1,000 people. The CDC recorded 4,100 cases between 1997 and 2008. Often times, farm workers get the bug on their hands and then transfer it to produce. Previous outbreaks in the U.S. have been linked to basil, snow peas and raspberries. But any fresh fruit or vegetable can carry the bug. So until health officials pinpoint the source of the cyclospora, people should wash all their fruits and vegetables thoroughly. "You can reduce the number of organisms on produce by washing it well," Ortega says. But to get rid of parasites completely, food has to be cooked. Sanitizers and bleach aren't going to work either. People with watery diarrhea and other symptoms of cyclospora should contact their doctors, Ortega says. "This will help the CDC figure out just how wide spread the outbreak is and track down the source." [Copyright 2013 NPR]

1008	Sam Simon, who helped create The Simpsons and continues to earn "tens of millions" of dollars each year from royalties generated by the show, is dying from colon cancer. Doctors say he has less than six months to live. Here's the part of his story we especially want to pass along: When he's gone, the 58-year-old writer and producer says, his Simpsons royalties will go to charity. The donations will come on top of the millions he's given away since striking it rich as a younger man. As The Hollywood Reporter says: "His contributions include founding the Malibu-based Sam Simon Foundation (worth nearly $23 million as of 2011) that rescues the hungry (humans — but with vegan foods only) and strays (dogs, of any variety). His other pet charities include PETA, which in February thanked him for his support by naming its Norfolk, Va., headquarters the Sam Simon Center; international nonprofit Save the Children; and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, a global marine conservation organization. His contributions led it to name one of the four ships in its fleet of vessels, used to hinder whaling and illegal fishing, the M/Y Simon in 2012. He also turned a Malibu spread into a canine haven that rescues dogs from kill shelters and trains them as companions for the deaf." Simon, whose other TV projects have included The Drew Carey Show and Anger Management, has no children and isn't now married. He says he isn't sure how much the royalties will be worth to charities after he's gone, but that it will be a lot. In an interview with the Reporter, he's asked about what's happened to him and the decision to give away his money: "THR: Do you get frustrated with bad things happening to good people? Like, why didn't someone else get this cancer? "Simon: No. I don't think that's what karma is. It never crossed my mind. But I don't think the spirit of Hollywood is such a spirit of generosity. I think people really begrudge giving. In New York, it's like that. A lot of charities spend a million dollars on a fundraiser to make $15,000. It's a social swirl. They do some great stuff and then — it's called mission drift. It becomes more about the parties. You know, I'm not married, and I don't have kids. I had an emergency operation when I was septic, and I really did come very close to dying. My colon cancer perforated my colon. When I woke up in the hospital, even though I did have a will, it did become that much more important to me to set this stuff up for the future. And the Rockefeller Foundation has consultants [Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors] who have been amazing. We found fantastic trustees. It's something that will be living after I'm gone." Back in May, Simon talked at length about all this on the WTF with Marc Maron podcast (for the record, there's a considerable amount of "adult" language during that interview). [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
1008	We recorded this week's episode during the brief interregnum between the end of Glen Weldon's trip to the San Diego Comic Con and the beginning of Linda Holmes' two weeks at the Television Critics Association press tour in Los Angeles. So it seemed a perfect time to mine the two events for inspiration. First, we get a sense from Glen — whose name is Welsh for "he who is uneasy around people" — of what it was like to be flushed into a sea of 130,000 enthusiastic souls; his answer may or may not surprise you. And, from there, we talk about fan gatherings of many different stripes. I talk a little South by Southwest and Newport Folk Festival (the latter of which I'm attending this weekend, so be sure to say hello!), guest panelist and departing producer Jess Gitner explains why she prefers chairs and the Internet, and Linda tells a story of how a small organic fan meet-up can suffer under the weight of expectations. Then it's on to a briefing from Linda in advance of her trip to TCA: trends in fall television, what it's like to tromp through the Big Brother house, the return of Michael J. Fox, the pending rise of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., a surefire sign that shows will fail, how broadcast networks hope to survive the encroaching domination of cable and the Internet, and more. And, as always, we close with What's Making Us Happy. Jess thanks folks for the kind words about her imminent departure, then praises a fun pop-music remix. Glen praises a new book about the world of comic books — and is so sure you'll love it, he urges you to buy it without first peeking at its pages. I'm giddy with anticipation for the Newport Folk Festival, as one tends to be, and brimming with praise for recent articles by my pals Glen and Linda. Linda cites an inspiring comment on her aforementioned essay, and urges everyone to check out the 13-year-old commenter's charming and imaginative work on YouTube. And, of course, we pay tribute to our departing pal Jess, who really is as great and good as we say she is. Find us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter: Linda, Glen, Jess, me, absent Trey, and our esteemed producer emeritus and music director, Mike Katzif. [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
1008	Nobody throws away a mason jar on Prince of Wales Island. On this rugged mass of mountain, forest, river and sea in southeast Alaska, most of the several thousand year-round residents subsist at least partially off the generous fat of the land. And much of the bounty is pressure cooked, preserved and stored away for the future. "If it stops crawling long enough, we'll put it in a jar," says Jon Rowan, a schoolteacher in the town of Klawock, on the island's west side. Rowan hunts, harvests and cans nearly every sort of creature that lives in the diverse, rain-drenched ecosystem of the region. His cellar is crammed with hundreds of jars of salmon, halibut, rockfish, lingcod, deer and even seal, which Rowan can legally shoot because he — like many of the island's several thousand people — has Native American roots. Seal blubber, Rowan says, is cooked for hours before going into the jar. It may be used for cooking or simply melted over rice — "kind of like how you use soy sauce at a Chinese restaurant," Rowan says. The meat of local seals is also canned. "It tastes like really rich duck," Rowan says. Mary Anna Murphy is one of only two permanent residents of the small Wadleigh Island, which flanks the west central shore of Prince of Wales (locals call it POW) just two miles from Klawock. On her 17-foot Boston Whaler, Murphy regularly makes the two-mile commute to town — often to bring jars of home-canned goods to her friends. Murphy — who has been certified as a "master canner" through a weeklong course in Juneau — keeps her pantry stocked with jars of salmon, halibut and deer, which Murphy says she usually shoots from her bedroom window. "I still have shells on the floor," she deadpans. Murphy has at times cooked and jarred black bear. She says bear meat can cause flatulence but otherwise is delicious. "You can render down the oil, too," she says. "I fry shrimp in it, and you'd swear it was olive oil." Vegetarians — if any exist on and around Prince of Wales Island — may also find themselves in a land of plenty here. Many of the local fruits and veggies are seasonal. But locals can make sea asparagus, kelp, fiddlehead ferns, spruce tips, wild mushrooms, huckleberries and salmonberries last all year by boiling jars full of these and other goodies in giant stove-top pressure cookers, which cause the containers to vacuum seal as they cool. Of course, such foods can also be dried or frozen, but canning offers unique benefits. The foods can last years without deteriorating or developing freezer burn, and they are ready to eat upon opening. And on an island where a latte costs $6, a fresh watermelon $15, and a can of salmon $10, residents may pinch pennies when they're able and can their own foods to save on the cost of a freezer. For most locals, the canning season begins in the spring, when the mighty Chinook — the biggest, greasiest and most succulent of the salmon clan — swarm local coves and seaward channels. In June and July, 3- to 5-pound pink salmon arrive by the millions, gathering in schools near shore before surging up almost every river, stream, brook and crick (outsiders say "creek") to spawn. Sockeye salmon, chum salmon and Coho salmon arrive in succeeding waves. Sitka black-tailed deer can be hunted several months of the year, and state law allows residents to take four annually. Mushrooms like porcini, chanterelles and shaggy manes burst from the mossy rainforest floor in late summer. Coral-like sulfur shelf mushrooms, called chicken-of-the-forest by islanders, balloon out of tree trunks and stumps in the fall. Kelp thrives in the almost everlasting sunlight of summer. All the while, countless mason jars make their own migrations within the small communities of Prince of Wales, cycling repeatedly from sink to pressure cooker to pantry, and back again. Lids cannot be reused, and islanders know where the best deals can be found on canning accessories. In South Thorne Bay, on the northeast side of the island, Tony and Jenny Wise own an idyllic home and garden on a hillside, replete with goats, chickens, veggies and one of the loneliest apple trees in the world. Like so many Prince of Wales residents, the Wises pack away almost countless jars of edibles for storage each year. They use a model 921 All American pressure cooker, which can fit 16 one-pint jars at once. The total time it takes to jar fish is about three hours, including 120 minutes of high-pressure cooking. Jenny adds nothing to a jar of salmon except salt. "That way, you can do whatever you want with it when you open it," she says. The Wises often eat jarred salmon with mayonnaise and bull kelp relish — another popular item in the stocked pantries of Prince of Wales Island. But even local subsistence hunters and gatherers may answer to the temptation of modern foods. "Once in a while," Rowan says, "we'll get a good pizza." [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
1008	Prosecutors said a large volume of evidence including electronic messages, court-ordered wiretaps and consensual recordings is stacked against a Connecticut-based hedge fund that pleaded not guilty Friday to criminal charges accusing it of letting insider trading flourish for more than a decade. Assistant U.S. Attorney Antonia Apps told a federal judge in Manhattan that investigators had &#8220;voluminous&#8221; evidence against SAC Capital Advisors, a Stamford, Conn.-based firm owned by billionaire Steven A. Cohen. She said the evidence included &#8220;electronic messages, instant messages, court-ordered wiretaps and consensual recordings.&#8221; The plea was entered by Peter Nussbaum, SAC&#8217;s longtime general counsel, and came a day after the company was charged with wire and securities fraud, accused of making hundreds of millions of dollars illegally. Federal prosecutors described a culture at SAC that permitted, if not encouraged, insider trading. Prosecutors said the victims were large companies whose inside information was stolen and traded upon. The next hearing was set for Sept. 24. GuestMarty Schenker, executive editor at Bloomberg.

1008	The train derailment in Spain is the latest in a series of disasters this year that have been caught on video and been played over and over again in the media. There was the meteorite that hit Russia, the Asiana Airlines crash landing in San Francisco and the oil train explosion in Quebec. What kind of psychological effect does that repeated exposure to tragic disaster imagery have on us? Suddenly we’re part of an international community of mourners, and I think that feels satisfying to us.&ndash;Eric Wilson &#8220;I think it does quite a few things to us,&#8221; Eric Wilson, author of &#8220;Everyone Loves A Good Train Wreck: Why We Can&#8217;t Look Away&#8221; told Here & Now. &#8220;Too much can actually be traumatic for someone watching. Also, watching these videos too much can lead to a numbness.&#8221; Trying to get media outlets not to show the videos is not the answer, Wilson said. &#8220;It&#8217;s up to the viewers to choose how often we watch these videos and ultimately figure out why we&#8217;re watching these videos. It we&#8217;re doing it for a cheap thrill, obviously we should question ourselves. If in the midst of watching these videos we&#8217;re thinking more deeply about suffering and the meaning of death then perhaps meditating on these videos isn&#8217;t such a bad thing,&#8221; he said. When there is a major disaster, people may feel compelled to watch the videos as a way of connecting to what&#8217;s happening. &#8220;In a world where we often feel isolated, where we often feel trapped in front of our own computer screen, trapped in our own rooms having virtual experiences not real contact, suddenly we&#8217;re part of an international community of mourners, and I think that feels satisfying to us,&#8221; Wilson said. &#8220;We are all at the same time mourning this tragedy in Spain.&#8221; While some people may be desensitized by disaster videos, others may have the opposite experience.

Two well-known economists are considered top contenders for the position: Larry Summers and Janet Yellen. Summers, who previously served as the president of Harvard University and Secretary of the Treasury in the Clinton administration from 1999 to 2001, has close ties to President Obama. But Summers received flak for his support of financial deregulation in the 1990s. Janet Yellen is second in command at the Federal Reserve.

1008	&#8220;The Engagements,&#8221; the new novel by J. Courtney Sullivan interweaves four tales about the significance of diamonds with the real-life story of Frances Gerety, who was a copywriter with the Philadelphia ad agency N.W. Ayer and Son beginning in the 1940s. Advertising Age magazine named “A Diamond is Forever,” the phrase that Gerety penned to help promote the De Beers company’s products, the slogan of the 20th century. Gerety herself was never married. “She really created these romantic ideas that we now associate with diamonds, but she herself was not romantic in anyway, it didn’t interest her” Sullivan said. “Because she was living in a time when really, a woman had to decide: Do I want to follow a career path or do I want to be married?” Gerety struggled under the glass ceiling at Ayer, and the company didn’t recognize her contributions until she was much older. &#8220;I came to really love her so much over the course of writing this book,&#8221; Sullivan said. Amnesty International: Conflict DiamondsBook Excerpt: &#8216;The Engagements&#8217; By J. Courtney Sullivan 1947 Frances poured the last bitter remains of the coffeepot into her cup. The small kitchen table was covered in paper: layouts, copies of confidential reports, lousy ideas she had scrapped hours ago, and good ones, already published in Look, Vogue, The Saturday Evening Post, Life, and Harper’s Bazaar, to remind her that she had done it before and could do it again. For once, the apartment building was silent. Usually, from off in some distant corner she could hear a baby crying, a couple arguing, a toilet flushing. But it was past three a.m. The revelers had long been asleep, and the milkmen weren’t yet awake. Her roommate had gone to bed around ten— at the sight of her standing there in her nightgown and curlers, Frances was overcome with professional jealousy, even though Ann was only a secretary in a law office, who would spend tomorrow the same way she spent every day, fetching coffee and taking dictation. Frances had just finished writing the newest De Beers copy, a honeymoon series with pictures of pretty places newlyweds might go— the rocky coast of Maine! Arizona! Paris! And something generic for people without much money, which she labeled By the river. In a way, that one was the most important of them all, since they were trying to appeal to the average Joe. A decade earlier, when De Beers first came on as a client, the agency had done a lot of surveying to find out the strength— or really the weakness— of the diamond engagement ring tradition. In those days, not many women had wanted one. It was considered just absolutely money down the drain. They’d take a washing machine or a new car, anything but an expensive diamond ring. She had helped to change all that. The honeymoon ads read, May your happiness last as long as your diamond. A pretty good line, she thought. “Time for bed, Frank,” she whispered to herself, the same words her mother had whispered to her every night when she was a child. She was just about to switch off the light when she saw the blank signature line that the art director had drawn on the layouts, which she was meant to fill in by morning. “Rats.” Frances sat back down, lit a cigarette, and picked up a pencil. A day earlier, Gerry Lauck, head of the New York office, had called her. “I think we should have something that identifies this as diamond advertising,” he said. “A signature line. What do you think?” When Gerry Lauck asked what you thought, it was wise to understand that he was not actually asking. In her opinion, the man was a genius. Unpredictable and a bit gloomy at times, but perhaps all geniuses were like that. “Yes, perfect,” she said. Gerry looked like Winston Churchill, he acted like Winston Churchill, and sometimes Frances believed he thought he was Winston Churchill. He even had fits of depression. The first time she had to go to New York to show him her ideas, she was scared to death. Gerry looked them over, his face giving no indication of what he thought. After several torturous minutes, he smiled and said, “Frances, you write beautifully. More important, you know how to sell.” They had liked each other ever since. Half the employees of N. W. Ayer were afraid of Gerry Lauck, or couldn’t stand him. The other half thought he hung the moon, and Frances was one of them. “The line shouldn’t say anything about De Beers, of course,” Gerry continued over the phone. “Of course.” For nine years, De Beers had spent millions on ads that barely mentioned the company itself. To even name it as a distributor would be breaking the law. So the advertisements were simply for diamonds, and they were beautiful. Ayer pulled out all the stops. They couldn’t show pictures of diamond jewelry in the ads, which left the art department in a pickle. In theory, Gerry had nothing to do with creative. He was a straight-up businessman and just handed out the assignments. But as an art lover, he thought to commission a series of original paintings from Lucioni, Berman, Lamotte, and Dame Laura Knight. He purchased preexisting works from some of the finest galleries in Europe for the De Beers collection, by Dalí, Picasso, and Edzard. The resulting four- color ads showed gorgeous landscapes, cities, cathedrals. Printed on the page, just below the artist’s creation, would be a box displaying illustrations of stones, ranging from half a carat to three carats, along with approximate prices for each. Gerry was the first person to create an ad campaign featuring fine art. A year or two later, everyone in the business was doing it. “I’ll need the tagline by tomorrow,” Gerry said. “I’ll be in to Philadelphia in the morning and then on to South Africa by late afternoon.” “Sure thing,” Frances said, and then promptly forgot all about it until now, the middle of the night. She sighed. If she hadn’t been bucking all her life for the title of World’s Biggest Procrastinator, maybe she ’d get some sleep one of these days. She knew she had to work tonight, but still she had stayed out with her pal Dorothy Dignam until Dorothy had to catch the nine o’clock train back to Penn Station. Dorothy started as an Ayer copywriter in the Philadelphia office in 1930, but soon after Frances came to the agency four years back, Dorothy moved to the New York office at 30 Rockefeller Center to head up the public relations department. Like Frances, De Beers was her main priority. They had publicists in Miami, Hollywood, and Paris, too, just for this one client. Dorothy had even arranged for the creation of a short film with Columbia Pictures, The Magic Stone: Diamonds Through the Centuries. It started playing in theaters in September 1945 and by the time the run was over, it had been seen by more than fifteen million people. Her friend would never tell her age, but Frances guessed that Dorothy was at least a decade and a half older than she was, probably about fifty. She had been in advertising in Chicago in the last year of the First World War. She was the Chicago Herald’s society reporter at seventeen years old and stayed until the day Mr. Hearst moved in and moved her out. She went from there to the offices of the Contented Cow milk company as a copywriter, and later to Ayer. Dorothy was a real hot ticket. She was something of a model for Frances. She had traveled the world for Ayer in the thirties, working in London, Paris, and Geneva for Ford, sailing to Norway and Sweden to study household electrical progress. She even made frequent visits to Hollywood, where she went to the Trocadero for dinner and saw all the stars. She once ran into Joan Crawford in Bullocks Wilshire. Dorothy bought size 16 of the dress that Joan had purchased in size 14. Just an inexpensive black daytime frock and very useful to both of us, I’m sure was how she had described it in a postcard she sent. Their dinner tonight had started off as a business meeting, but after two martinis each they were laughing uproariously at a table at Bookbinder’s, eating oysters and telling jokes about the fellas at work. They were endlessly amused by the things they were expected to know as women in the office. A few years ago, Dorothy started keeping a sheet of paper in the vacant drawer under her typewriter, and every question that was asked of her, she typed down. Tonight, she had read Frances a few of the latest: “How should a woman look when her son is seventeen? Could a winter hat have a bird’s nest on it? Is Macy’s singular or plural? Do women ever warble in the bathtub? What’s the difference between suede and buck? Does Queen Mary have a nice complexion? How many times a day do you feed a baby? Is this thing an inverted pleat?” They had had a ball, but now Frances would have to pay the price. She glanced at a sheet of paper, a recent strategy plan, and read, We are dealing primarily with a problem in mass psychology. We seek to maintain and strengthen the tradition of the diamond engagement ring— to make it a psychological necessity. Target audience: some seventy million people fifteen years and over whose opinion we hope to influence in support of our objectives. Well, that narrowed it down nicely. In 1938, a representative of Sir Ernest Oppenheimer, president of De Beers Consolidated Mines, wrote to Ayer to inquire whether, as he put it, “the use of propaganda in various forms” might boost the sales of diamonds in America. The Depression had caused diamond prices to plummet around the world. Consumer interest had all but vanished. There were only half as many diamonds sold in America as there had been before the war, and the few diamond engagement rings still being purchased were inexpensive and small. De Beers had reserve stocks they couldn’t possibly sell. Oppenheimer was eager to bring the diamond engagement ring to prominence in the United States, and he had it on good authority that Ayer was the best in the business, the only agency for the job. He proposed a campaign at $500,000 annually for the first three years. What Ayer had done for De Beers was a true testament to the power of advertising. By 1941, diamond sales had increased by 55 percent. After the Second World War, the number of weddings in America soared, and diamonds went right along with them. The price of diamonds went up, too: Today, a two- carat diamond could range in price from $1,500 to $3,300. In 1939, it would have been $900 to $1,750. They had created a whole new sort of advertising for this campaign, and other agencies had been copying it ever since. In the absence of a direct sale to be made, or a brand name to be introduced, there was only an idea: the emotional currency attached to a diamond. De Beers produced less than they could, to keep supply low and price high. Not only did their advertising approach boost sales, it also ensured that, once sold, a diamond would never return to the marketplace. After Frances got finished pulling their heartstrings, widows or even divorcées would not want to part with their rings. On occasion over the years, she had imagined what the Oppenheimers must look like. The peculiar particulars of their relationship stoked her imagination, making her wonder what their faces did when they saw her newest ideas. Were there raised eyebrows? Slight smiles? Exclamations? It was unusual for her not to have met a client, but De Beers was prohibited from coming to the United States because of the cartel. The company controlled the world supply of rough diamonds, a monopoly so strong that the mere presence of its representatives in America violated the law. They operated out of Johannesburg and London. Once a year, Gerry Lauck took the ads she wrote to South Africa in a thick leatherbound book for their approval. He kept a set of golf clubs there, since it was easier than lugging them back and forth from New York. The fi rst time Gerry went to Johannesburg to present market research to the Oppenheimers, the small seaplane he was traveling on made a crash landing off the Island of Mozambique. He used the large mounted maps and charts he had brought along as flotation devices to get to shore. Two others on board died, and The New York Times ran the headline airliner is wrecked in southeast africa: american escapes injury. Gerry felt that the presentation quite literally saved his life, and perhaps for that reason, he was willing to do whatever it took for De Beers. Her roommate let out a great snore in the next room, interrupting Frances’s thoughts. Ann was waiting on a marriage proposal from a dull accountant she had been dating for a while now. After that, Frances would be back on the hunt for a new roommate, as had tended to happen every few months or so since the war ended. Rose, Myrtle, Hildy: one by one, she had lost them all to matrimony. But she was up for a promotion at the office, so perhaps when Ann left she could finally afford to live alone. When Frances started working at Ayer four years ago, at the age of twenty- eight, she had convinced her parents that it was time for her to move away from home and into the city. But her paycheck demanded that she get a roommate to help with the rent. She wanted a house of her own on the Main Line. Then she ’d never have to worry about getting enough hot water in the shower on winter mornings, or tolerating Ann’s nasally soprano as she accompanied Dinah Shore on the radio at night. She relished and  reamed about the prospect of living alone, the same way most single girls probably dreamed about married life. Frances ran a finger over one of her new honeymoon ads. Other women never seemed to think about what came next. They were so eager to be paired up, as if marriage was known to be full of splendor. Frances was the opposite: she could never stop thinking about it. She might go to dinner or out dancing with someone new, and have a fi ne time. But when she got home and climbed into bed afterward, her heart would race with fear. If she went out with him again, then they might go out again after that. Eventually, she would have to take him home to be evaluated by her parents, and vice versa. Then he would propose. And she, like all the other working girls who had married before her, would simply disappear into a life of motherhood and isolation. Excerpted from the book THE ENGAGEMENTS by J. Courtney Sullivan.

1008	San Diego Mayor Bob Filner said Friday he will undergo therapy after less than a year in office amid allegations that he sexually harassed women. Filner announced his plans after a series of women claimed he kissed, groped and placed them in headlocks. Filner apologized to voters, his staff and the women he allegedly harassed, but added: &#8220;Words alone are not enough. I am responsible for my conduct. And I must take responsibly for my conduct.&#8221; The allegations resulted in widespread calls for him to resign, plunging the nation&#8217;s eighth-largest city into political turmoil. When the allegations surfaced, Filner apologized for disrespecting women and said he needed help. But soon after, he said he was innocent of sexual harassment and resisted calls to leave office. The chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee called on Filner to resign as did leaders of the San Diego Democratic party. The former congressman was San Diego&#8217;s first Democratic mayor in 20 years. Filner&#8217;s own political party called for the leader of the nation&#8217;s eighth-largest city to resign as four more women identified themselves as targets of his sexual harassment, bringing to seven the number of women who have offered detailed accounts that include unwanted touching.

1008	Rajiv Chandrasekaran was Baghdad bureau chief for the Washington Post in 2003 and 2004. During that time, he hired several Iraqis to work as interpreters or drivers. Many of them eventually came to the U.S. If guys like Omar can go back, maybe they can accomplish what the United States military and the U.S. government so profoundly failed to do.&ndash;Rajiv Chandrasekaran This year, which marked the 10th anniversary of the start of the war, Chandrasekaran set out to find the Iraqis who worked for the post during the war, to find out how their lives are going in America. Omar Fekeiki was one of those Iraqis. He worked as an interpreter and special correspondent for the Washington Post in Baghdad from 2003 to 2006. He got the job by accident. &#8220;It was a pure coincidence, actually,&#8221; Fekeiki told Here & Now. &#8220;I was trying to get a phone to call my relatives in London to tell them that we survived the war, and the only way to do that was to try to get one of the journalists who were covering Iraq to lend me the phone. A few minutes later I found this foreign journalist, who happened to be Mary Beth Sheridon of the Post, trying to converse with Iraqis, but they didn&#8217;t speak English, she didn&#8217;t speak Arabic, and I volunteered to translate. And 30 minutes, 45 minutes later she introduced me to Rajiv who actually offered me the job on the spot, as a translator.&#8221; Today, Fekeiki lives in Landover, Maryland. He&#8217;s an assignment editor for Radio Sawa, a U.S.-funded station that beams news and pop music across the Arab world. He hopes to return home to help his country. &#8220;This time when I go back to Iraq, I&#8217;m going to have an even bigger responsibility, because now I am going to be the American who is back to help Iraqis. And then my countrymen, Iraqis and Americans &#8212; funny to say that &#8212; will realize that we can co-exist and we can help each other and it doesn&#8217;t have to be a failure, like it has been in the last ten years,&#8221; Fekeiki said.

1008	The second juror to speak publicly told ABC News that she feels George Zimmerman got away with murder for fatally shooting Trayvon Martin, but that there wasn&#8217;t enough evidence at trial to convict him under Florida law. Juror B29 told Robin Roberts that she favored convicting Zimmerman of second-degree murder when deliberations began by the six-member, all-women jury. &#8220;I was the juror that was going to give them a hung jury,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I fought to the end.&#8221; But by the second day of deliberating, she realized there wasn&#8217;t enough proof to convict the 29-year-old neighborhood watch volunteer of a crime. &#8220;George Zimmerman got away with murder, but you can&#8217;t get away from God,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And at the end of the day, he&#8217;s going to have a lot of questions and answers he has to deal with.&#8221; Zimmerman was acquitted earlier this month of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges in the 2012 slaying of the unarmed 17-year-old. The Miami teenager was shot and killed during a confrontation with Zimmerman in Sanford. The case spawned heated national debates about racial profiling and the so-called Stand Your Ground self-defense laws in Florida and other states. Zimmerman was seen publicly for the first time last week when he assisted a family after their SUV flipped over on a Florida highway. Juror B29 is the second panelist to go public with what went on during deliberations earlier this month. She allowed her face to be shown and used her first name, Maddy, unlike Juror B37, who was interviewed on CNN last week with her face obscured. Four jurors, not including the one interviewed by ABC, issued a statement last week saying the opinions expressed by Juror B37 to CNN&#8217;s Anderson Cooper did not represent their views. That juror said the actions of Zimmerman and Martin both led to the teenager&#8217;s fatal shooting, but that Zimmerman didn&#8217;t actually break the law. Juror B29 also told ABC that she didn&#8217;t believe race was an issue at the trial. Though the judge so far has refused to release the names or biographical information about the jurors, B29 said she was 36 years old and Puerto Rican. Martin was black and Zimmerman identifies himself as Hispanic. Martin&#8217;s parents believe Zimmerman racially profiled their son when he started following him after spotting him walking through the neighborhood where Zimmerman lived and Martin was visiting. B29 said she couldn&#8217;t speak for her fellow jurors on the race issue. The other women on the jury were white. Juror B29 is a nursing assistant and mother of eight children who recently moved to Florida from Chicago. She said she feels like she owes Martin&#8217;s parents an apology. &#8220;I felt like I let a lot of people down, and I&#8217;m thinking to myself, `Did I go the right way? Did I go the wrong way?&#8221;&#8216; she said. &#8220;As much as we were trying to find this man guilty &#8230; They give you a booklet that basically tells you the truth, and the truth is that there was nothing that we could do about it.&#8221; Watch the interview on ABCGuestEmily Bazelon, legal affairs editor for Slate magazine and senior research fellow at Yale Law School.

Not because it's always pleasant and happy, but because that's where the meat of life is, "the juice that we can suck out of our hours and days." In 2004, Saunders skied solo to the North Pole. Saunders' next outdoor excursion? To try to be the first in the world to walk from the coast of Antarctica to the South Pole and back again. About Ben Saunders Ben Saunders became the youngest person ever to ski solo to the North Pole. Saunders is an explorer of limits, whether it's how far a human can be pushed physically and psychologically, or how technology works hundreds of miles from civilization. His message is one of inspiration, empowerment and boundless potential. Saunders is also a powerful advocate for the natural world. He's seen firsthand the effects of climate change, and his expeditions are raising awareness for sustainable solutions. [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
1008	Part 2 of the TED Radio Hour episode To The Edge. About Bill Stone's TEDTalk Bill Stone is a maverick cave explorer who has plumbed Earth's deepest abysses. In this talk, he explains what it's like to descend into the deepest caves in complete darkness for days on end — and why he keeps doing it. About Bill Stone Engineer and daredevil caver Bill Stone pushes the frontier — through flooded tunnels, the remotest depths of the Earth and the limits of human endurance. He's currently planning to mine moon ice by 2015 and build an autonomous robot to visit the icebound sea of Jupiter's moon, Europa. His Shackleton Energy Company intends to raise enough money to mine ice thought to be trapped on the moon's southern pole at Shackleton Crater, and to sell derived products on the moon and in low Earth orbit to international consumers.
