202998957	While South Africa celebrates the 95th birthday of Nelson Mandela on Thursday, the former president and Nobel Peace Prize laureate remains at a Pretoria hospital, where he's been hospitalized since June 8 with a recurring lung infection. President Jacob Zuma's office has said that Mandela is in "critical but stable" condition, though Mandela's daughter Zindzi said Wednesday that her father was making "remarkable progress" and could be released soon. The Nelson Mandela Center of Memory asked South Africans and people around the world to spend 67 minutes Thursday volunteering in their communities in tribute to the ailing former president. The 67 minutes represents the 67 years Mandela gave in public service fighting against the apartheid system of segregation and later as a statesman. Ever since he was hospitalized more than a month ago, small shrines to Mandela have popped up all across the country. His picture hangs in shop windows. The newspapers and TV stations give daily updates on Madiba, his clan name that many use when referring to him. Brenda Motseari, a teacher in the township of Soweto, says Mandela remains a huge figure in South African life. "Nelson Mandela is a father, a mentor, a motivator, a director. He's everything to South Africans," she says. Motseari had just come out of a Mass at the Regina Mundi Catholic Church in the Rockville section of Soweto. A stained glass window depicts Mandela in a jacket and tie with his hands raised as he addresses a crowd. An Enduring Image  The scene resembles the one on Feb. 11, 1990, when Mandela was released from prison. Standing on the balcony of Cape Town City Hall, he greeted a crowd of hundreds of thousands of people. Motseari says she remembers that day clearly. She'd just had a baby, and she was glued to the television. She says that day is still the most powerful image she remembers of Mandela. "That's my memory [of him], the first day when he picked up the fist after coming out of prison," she says. "I was watching attentively and then he clenched the fist to say, 'Amandla' [power]." In that speech, Mandela declared, "Today the majority of South Africans, black and white, recognize that apartheid has no future." Before those remarks, most South Africans didn't even know what Mandela looked like. Pictures of him had been banned by the apartheid government. Stepping out from prison, Mandela called for a negotiated end to apartheid and an end to white minority rule. That eventually happened and in 1994 Mandela was elected president in South Africa's first nonracial, democratic elections. Drawing Inspiration The pastor at the Regina Mundi church, Sebastian Rossouw, says Mandela's life continues to be an inspiration to South Africans. "Growing up in apartheid years as a young boy one was not free," the priest says. Rossouw and his family couldn't travel freely. His father wasn't allowed to set foot in certain parts of town. Blacks weren't allowed to vote. There were separate buses, schools and toilets for whites. Interracial marriages were forbidden. Blacks and coloreds ended up in the worst jobs. Educational options for Rossouw were restricted by law. But the priest says Mandela made it clear that any obstacle, any injustice can be overcome. "The legacy that Mandela brings is that despite what the past has dealt you, do not allow it to determine your future," Rossouw says. "For many of us, myself included, that's a message that we've taken to heart. Yes, we have a bad past but this will not affect the future we are looking towards." [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
203034882	Hari Kondabolu is a brainy comedian who cuts through the polite talk around race and gender. He's made a lot of key people laugh with his incisive anecdotes, including Jimmy Kimmel, Conan O'Brien and John Oliver. A full-time writer on the FX show Totally Biased with W. Kamau Bell, he recently did a comedy bit on the National Spelling Bee, or "as I like to call it," he joked, "the Indian Super Bowl." Kondabolu makes a fair point: for six years in a row, the winner has been Indian-American. As a result, he continued, "it gives me great pleasure to finally be able to say 'Hey white people, learn the language." At first he was reluctant to write a bit about South Asians winning the spelling bee because it's kind of a cliché. "At the same time, I'm like: let's own it," Kondabolu explains. "There's nothing embarrassing about kids doing well at school and dominating that happen to be South Asian, which is very exciting for me. And there aren't any South Asian athletes. I mean Jeremy Lin was Taiwanese-American, I took ownership of that, it's as close as we've gotten. "But this is something we dominate at. This isn't the Indian Cricket team. These are South Asian Americans, Indian Americans dominating. And I loved it." Thirteen-year-old Arvind Mahankali won this year's spelling bee. During his interview after his victory, he said that he planned to spend the rest of his summer studying physics. Kondabolu jokes, "He's a two-sport athlete!" A Time To Unite? Kondabolu was born and raised in a diverse neighborhood in Queens, N.Y., which he describes as having "different immigration status, different income levels, different languages, different parts of the world, it was incredible." His parents were born in India and moved to the U.S. when they were in their twenties. Kondabolu describes a time in his childhood when his mother took he and his brother to Burger King, because she wanted them to assimilate into American society. "We never saw something strange about that," he says. "As I got older, it was kind of bizarre, like 'Wait a second, why are you, why? Why did you take us to Burger King and, if we're Hindu, how come you let us eat beef?' She said that she wanted us to get used to what it was like to be an American, and apparently Burger King, well it's fast food. What's more American than fast food?" His mother, Uma Kondabolu, laughs as she says that, yes, she did take her sons to Burger King because it is very American. But also where they found people of all backgrounds. "That's where they played with kids of all colors," she says. "And I used to meet with other parents of all colors." Uma wanted her kids to see that interacting with people of all colors was not "bad" or "scary." And Hari Kondabolu says that he felt safe growing up in his Queens neighborhood. He didn't think racism was a serious problem until the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11. "You hear about the hate violence all around the country, even in New York, and I think that's what struck me the most, it was happening in New York, and it was confusing, because I grew up in Queens, I grew up in New York, and we just dealt with this terrorism, we dealt with 9/11," says Kondabolu, who was 18 when the World Trade Center attacks happened. "And you're telling me, after this, everyone's claiming we're all coming together, we're getting closer, this is a time where we unite. It's like, really? Because, in my community, I see people getting hurt and being put into detention centers." As a result, Kondabolu became politically active. He worked in the Queens District Attorney's Office Bureau of Hate Crimes, went to Seattle to work for an immigrant rights group, and got his masters in human rights at the London School of Economics. All the while, his stand-up comedy was just a hobby. The idea of doing it full-time came when, in the early 1990s, Kondabolu saw Margaret Cho on Comedy Central. "To see someone who wasn't black or Latino or white do stand-up was huge," Kondabulo explains. "And she was talking about immigrant parents, and I have immigrant parents — my parents are different from her parents, but she was talking about it. And that was OK, and it was funny. I was so amazed by that. I wanted to do that after watching her perform." 'A Good Laugh Over A Drink' Today, Kondabolu's material is not so much about his own family, but about being an outsider in general — or at least being treated like one. And he's not afraid of challenging some long standing beliefs. "How do people justify homophobia in this country? 'Y'know, it's not Adam and Steve, it's Adam and Eve,'" he said at a recent show at the Black Cat in Washington, D.C. "Look, technically that is true. Right, it was Adam and Eve. But if you remember the story, it was Adam and Eve and a talking serpent. I feel like the talking serpent throws the whole account into question. I don't know how true this is. There's a talking snake involved. Maybe you shouldn't base your values on a Jungle Book-type scenario. What would Baloo do? What about Shere Khan? What about Winnie the Pooh? Oh, is that a different world? Does it matter at this point? That's a Jungle Book-type scenario. Look, I'm an Indian-Hindu alright. I know all about Jungle Book-type scenarios. That is a Jungle Book-type scenario." Kondabolu says he knows some people won't like his point of view. "I've been approached after shows from people who said, 'I don't agree with anything you said, but I laughed the whole way through.' That's still a little strange to me. Like, nothing? Really? But at the same time that's what happens in a conversation. You might not agree with everything the other person is saying, but you can still have a good laugh over a drink, right?" At the show in Washington, D.C., the audience was very diverse and didn't seem to have a problem with his point-of-view. "People keep bringing up the year 2042 on the news when census figures indicate that whites will be the minority," he joked. "In 2042, apparently white people will be 49 percent. First of all, why do we give a f--k? Why do we keep mentioning this? Why is this even an issue? Are there white people here that are concerned that they'll be the minority in 2042. Don't worry white people, you were a minority when you came to this country. Things seemed to have worked out for you." Kondabolu also recently recorded material for his first live comedy album, being released on the record label Kill Rock Stars. Although the label is best known for punk rock, Kondabolu thinks it's a perfect fit. [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
202970802	The past two weeks in Egypt have been a real test for the TV network Al-Jazeera. Accusations that the network is biased toward the Muslim Brotherhood and ousted Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi have resulted in arrests, threats and resignations. On the last day of June and the first days of July, as millions of Egyptians took to the streets to call for Morsi's downfall, Al-Jazeera was there. The network's Live Egypt channel went to a split screen. The pro-Morsi areas of Cairo were almost always shown as full. The anti-Morsi areas were shown as empty. It was later revealed that the anti-Morsi areas were usually packed — Al-Jazeera just showed them at the times of day that they were empty. Then came the killing of more than 50 pro-Morsi demonstrators by Egyptian security forces. Some Al-Jazeera reports initially said the number was in the hundreds. The military later held a press conference on the killings. An Al-Jazeera correspondent was booed out of the room by other reporters. For Haggag Salama, who had freelanced for Al-Jazeera for 10 years, the misreporting of the number of slain protesters was the last straw. He called another local TV station and announced his resignation on air. Salama says Al-Jazeera had no sources and exaggerated the numbers to favor the Muslim Brotherhood. In the days that followed, reports surfaced that some 20 more Al-Jazeera employees had quit — although at least one might have been a fake and others now say they will probably go back. Media watchers say it's important to stress the difference between Al-Jazeera Live Egypt, Al-Jazeera Arabic and Al-Jazeera English. The latter is the channel most well-known in the U.S., and Al-Jazeera English correspondents maintain their coverage is unbiased. They also say part of what's happening in Egypt is a witch hunt by some Egyptians who are now rabidly anti-Morsi and anti-Muslim Brotherhood. Other Islamist channels have been closed down since Morsi's ouster. Posters around Cairo show Al-Jazeera's logo in red with a bloody hand scratching at it. A bullet can kill a man, the poster says, but a lying camera can kill a nation. Either way, the Al-Jazeera name has taken a hit, says Marwan Kraidy, who studies Arab media at the University of Pennsylvania. And it's time for the network to do some soul-searching. "There might be some room for changing," Kraidy says. "And I do hope that that does happen. Because otherwise ... you're running what's truly an internationally unique institution that had its moment of brilliance into the ground." Al-Jazeera's loss of credibility also reflects a loss of credibility for its main backer, Qatar. Talk-show host Bassem Yousef, who is often described as the Jon Stewart of Egypt, recently mocked Qatar's backing of Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood, with songs and flags and costumes. Kraidy says now that Morsi has been deposed, Qatar lost more than face. "In addition to several billion dollars that they had invested in Mr. Morsi and his government in aid, they really lost a lot of influence in what remains a very, very major country," Kraidy says. The new emir of Qatar, Sheik Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, who took power just last month, will now have to decide whether he wants to reshape Al-Jazeera, his country's best-known brand name, Kraidy says.

202335743	Before it became China's capital in 1949, Beijing was a fairly provincial little city of 2 million people. Today, it has grown into a megalopolis of some 18 million people. I've recently returned to the city after a few years away, the first thing that strikes me is: Who the heck are all of these 20-somethings and how did they get to be driving all these Ferraris and Maseratis? I'm standing outside a shopping mall full of clothing stores, and it just so happens that there are two Ferraris, one red and one white parked outside. And sure enough there's a very young looking guy getting his handbag out of the trunk of the Ferrari. I ask him a couple of questions and find out that this guy's family name is Zhang, that he's from China's Inner Mongolia region and builds roads there, and that at age 25, he can afford a Ferrari 458 Spider, which he says cost him $912,000, all taxes and fees included. That's about all he'll tell me, so I've got only a sketchy answer to my questions. Not far from the Ferraris, a blind man plays his musical instrument for spare change. The sound reminds me of the old Beijing neighborhoods where I used to live. Now I'm living another life in a new part of the city, where I hear very few Beijing accents and there is probably more Thai food and sushi than Beijing-style dumplings and noodles. It reminds me of Manhattanites complaining that, before you know it, you'll have to go to Brooklyn to get a slice of pizza. Out in the suburbs, I met a violin maker named Guan Zheng. He was born in Beijing in 1959. Some residents have been exiled to the city's fringes, their homes demolished by developers. But Guan says his life is much improved since he moved from a crowded old courtyard in the city center four years ago. "Now we have more than 2,000 square feet for our family of three. I feel that's already pretty good," Guan says. "But we don't have the same atmosphere. Neighbors don't ask after each other in the same ways: 'Have you eaten yet?' 'How are you?' People are cut off from each other, living in these concrete shells." Qi Xin, a researcher at Beijing's Academy of Social Sciences, says that younger, richer people are moving into Beijing's center, while older, poorer residents move out. He also explains that, for most of the second half of the last century, China's cities didn't really have neighborhoods based on income levels. The state decided where everybody lived. "At that time, people did not have the freedom to choose their homes," Qi says. "Everyone belonged to work units, and that is what determined your work and life." Qi says that in recent years, Beijing's population has been growing at an unprecedented rate of more than 10 percent a year. But like other great cities, Beijing has always been able to absorb and assimilate the newcomers. So just as there's still plenty of pizza in Manhattan, I'm not too worried that I'll have to go to the suburbs just to buy a plate of dumplings. [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
200871130	Looking crisp and official in his khaki-colored sheriff's department polo shirt, Steve Steinhardt says Sheboygan, Wis., is a pretty good place to be a director of emergency services. "Nothing bad happens here," he says, knocking on wood. Unless, that is, you count the tuberculosis outbreak that struck the orderly Midwestern city of 50,000 this spring and summer. "I never expected TB to be one of the bigger emergencies I'd face when I got into this field," Steinhardt says. Sheboygan County officials have had to scramble to contain it. At the height of the crisis, the county activated its emergency operation center — a step usually reserved for major fires, floods and tornadoes. The county has had to borrow personnel from other jurisdictions, calm parents of schoolchildren, find housing to isolate infected families and appeal to the state for millions of dollars in extra money to deal with the situation. It's a reminder that TB — a disease most Americans may view as a relic of the 19th century — is still an insidious threat that can pop up anywhere. In its advanced stages, tuberculosis can destroy lungs, damage other organs and cause death. The Sheboygan outbreak came to light on April 11. The first case was a woman at the center of a large, close-knit family. Health officials decline to identify the family, but they say the people were part of an immigrant community, a common theme in most current TB outbreaks in the U.S. Sheboygan is home to sizable populations from Mexico and Southeast Asia, where TB is common. Asian immigrants make up half of Wisconsin's recent TB cases. Refugees among the Hmong people of Laos and Thailand have been among the most difficult-to-treat cases. Public health nurse Jean Beineman says the first case in the current outbreak is a middle-aged mother who had suffered from TB for many months. "[She] had symptoms since at least last August — weight loss, cough, just feeling poorly," Beinemann says. By early May, Sheboygan County health workers found active TB in three other family members, spread over several households. And others had symptoms and abnormal chest X-rays. Ominously, several were schoolchildren. "Once the families were identified, we knew we had a tiger by its tail," says Dale Hippensteel, Sheboygan County's public health manager. But the really bad news was that the woman at the epidemic's center had a TB strain resistant to at least two of the main drugs used to treat the infection. That's known as multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, or MDR-TB. It's especially hard to cure. The antibiotics can cost around $300,000 for a single case. Officials worried the MDR bacteria had spread to a lot of other people in town. Epidemiologists predicted Sheboygan could end up with 15 symptomatic MDR-TB cases and up to 200 people infected with the resistant strain but not yet showing symptoms. Asymptomatic, or latent, TB isn't contagious. But it has to be treated with antibiotics for six months to a year. The kids in the family with active TB infections attended a Sheboygan high school and middle school. One big priority was to see if they had transmitted the disease to their classmates. "We tested about 130 students and teachers who had very close contacts with the affected individuals," Beinemann says. The results of a second round of testing aren't yet known. More than three months after the outbreak first came to light, there have been nine confirmed cases of active TB among five households. Fortunately, none of the other cases is as drug-resistant as the first one. It's not clear yet how many other people in Sheboygan will turn out to be infected. Officials think it will be in the dozens. That may not sound like such a big deal. But treating TB infections of any kind is complex and labor-intensive. Every day, without exception, a nurse must watch each person take medication. A lapse in treatment could cause them to develop a multidrug-resistant strain. Active TB has to be treated until it's no longer contagious. That can take up to a year. Officials recently moved the woman with MDR-TB into an apartment paid for by the county. Keeping her and the others apart from everyone while they're contagious requires continuous monitoring and education. And the cost of all this is enormous. When officials feared they faced a wider epidemic of highly resistant TB, they projected it would cost the county $17 million to bring it under control. In the end, Sheboygan dodged that worst-case scenario. But it had to persuade the governor and state legislature to appropriate around $5 million to deal with the situation. Still, Lorna Will, Wisconsin's TB control director, says Sheboygan has avoided a much higher number of TB infections than it might have had. "That's because we jumped on them and got them right away," she says. But across the nation, the ability to jump on these outbreaks is eroding fast. TB in the U.S. is at an all-time low, with less than 10,000 cases each year. But a recent survey by the National TB Controllers Association shows 60 percent of states have cut their TB control budgets. Many health workers say cases of TB are being missed and they can't investigate outbreaks the way they used to. This reminds Dr. Richard Chaisson of what happened in the early 1990s. Funding cuts in TB programs led to a resurgence of the disease. "We corrected that mistake, and we've had great results,"says Chaisson, who directs TB research at Johns Hopkins University. "Now we're making that same mistake all over again, which is declaring victory and withdrawing from the fight before the disease is controlled." "Overall TB rates won't go back to the 1992 level, Chaisson says. "But outbreaks like Sheboygan's will start popping up more often ... and stopping them will cost a lot more than keeping TB under control." [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
202626305	For embattled Portuguese President Anibal Cavaco Silva, Oct. 5 started bad, and then got even worse. Presiding over a ceremony for Portugal's Republic Day, the president raised the Portuguese flag in front of a crowd of dignitaries. But by accident, the flag was upside down. The ceremony, held in an 18th-century courtyard near the Tagus River, had been closed to protesters. But near the end of the president's speech, security guards opened up the gates. Protesters rushed in, including Portuguese opera singer Ana Maria Pinto, who proceeded to drown out the president in song. "I wanted to speak to the Portuguese and sing for them. Just do it! Have the courage to have your own voice!" Pinto, 31, told NPR in a recent interview. But she recalled feeling nervous that October morning, confronting her nation's leaders: "The only thing I felt was my heart beating — all my body was my heart beating." Security guards huddled around the president and whisked him out of the courtyard. But the remaining dignitaries were flustered. "You could see on their faces that they were really confused, because I was singing opera," Pinto said. "At the end they asked me, 'Is this part of the event?' And I said, 'No, this is my protest!' " From that day on, Ana Maria Pinto has become a household name in Portugal. She is the new face — and (soprano) voice — of the country's protest movement. A regular at street demonstrations, Pinto is leading choirs of regular folks venting their anger over austerity — the strict budget cuts and tax hikes tied to Portugal's bailout by Europe. Protests, With Flowers And Songs While anti-austerity protesters throw Molotov cocktails in the streets of Athens or blockade parliament in Madrid, their Portuguese counterparts are singing songs in the street, 1960s-style. "The Portuguese people are not violent, and that's not because we are weak," Pinto said. "It's a different nature." Portugal's anger over austerity is more melancholy, less fiery, than other southern Europeans. And part of the reason for that is history, says economic historian Pedro Lains, who teaches at the University of Lisbon. "You have to take into account that Greece had a civil war in the 1940s. Spain had a civil war in the 1930s," Lains says. "Portugal had a very important civil war as well, but in the 1830s — much earlier. And since then, things have been more or less settled." Some Portuguese protesters take inspiration from their country's 1974 Carnation Revolution, a peaceful military coup that ended Portugal's dictatorship and led to a withdrawal from its African colonies. At the time, ordinary citizens flooded the streets and inserted carnation flowers into the muzzles of soldiers' rifles. Carnations are still common at anti-austerity protests in Lisbon today. Among the songs Pinto has introduced at such protests is "Acordai," Portuguese for "Wake Up." It's a ballad written by the late Fernando Lopes-Graça, a 20th-century Portuguese composer and Communist Party member, who used music to campaign against the former Portuguese dictatorship. The song Pinto belted out at the president last fall was another of Lopes-Graça's anti-fascist folk songs, "Firmeza." "[It means] firm — a person who is steady," Pinto said, translating the lyrics from Portuguese. "It talks about being yourself and not allowing someone who is above you to abuse [you]." Bringing Her Own Megaphone It's that sentiment that motivated Pinto to break out of the rarefied world of classical music and join Portugal's burgeoning street protests. She even bought her own megaphone. "I'm just a normal citizen," she said in an interview at Martinho da Arcada, a downtown Lisbon cafe that's been a hangout for Portuguese poets and revolutionaries for 230 years. "I just have this strong instinct of protecting what I love, and I do deeply love my country." NPR accompanied Pinto back to that courtyard overlooking the Tagus River, where she interrupted the president's speech, and asked her to sing the same song again. "This is the first time I've been here since October, and a lot of things have happened since then," she said wistfully. Portugal's unemployment rate is approaching a record 18 percent, and poverty is rising. But the movement Pinto started here is growing. She recently founded the Intervention Choir of Porto, in her hometown in northern Portugal. It's a choir that rehearses every Saturday and performs at street protests nationwide. Its mission is to advance the spirit of the protest Pinto carried out by interrupting the president last October, using music as a tool for resistance. "I think I feel some peace now," Pinto said. "Somehow I can see a bit of light there, at the end. It feels good." [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
200869850	Estonia's capital, Tallinn, is considered one of the world's leading "smart" cities, where the government and businesses alike rely heavily on computer technology. But one group in the Estonian capital is using the Internet for something completely different: an online forum that markets good deeds. It's called the Bank of Happiness, but it doesn't involve money or credit. Founded five years ago in this Baltic city, it's a forum in which more than 2,000 civic-minded individuals from Estonia and other countries connect to offer or receive services free of charge. The site carries more than 500 ads in English, German and Estonian from people offering or seeking all kinds of things, including tutoring, tips on baking and business, and even juggling lessons. The website is also translated into French and Spanish. Founder Airi Kivi says the goal is to make people think and act with their hearts. "I thought, 'We need something like this Bank of Happiness, where people can meet each other and do something cool,' " says the 39-year-old Kivi, who is a family therapist and clinical psychologist. The fact that the Estonian economy was in shambles at the time — 2008 — didn't factor into her decision, Kivi says. "But a little bit later, I thought, 'Wow, [the] Bank of Happiness is perfect for this economic crisis and a lot of people are unemployed and they can use our bank,' " she adds. So how does it work? It's simple: You register using your real name and post what you are offering or what your need is, as long as it doesn't involve cash or products. The site relies on members to report violators, of which there have been few, Kivi says. As a masseuse, Tallinn resident Terge Reintem has one of the more popular postings on the bank. One of her clients is Kivi. She pays Reintem with a "thank you." Kivi says a hug or box of chocolates is also acceptable tender as long as it's heartfelt and not mandated. "This is something that is very important to us, that we don't have any exact credit or measures that you gave 10 times massage and now you have 10 points," the founder explains. Reintem says that's fine with her. She says she signed up when she was unemployed because she needed to practice her skills. She says she stayed on even after finding a new job because it feels good to volunteer. "If I discover a new technique, I can practice them on my bank clients first," Reintem says, adding they are often nicer than the paying ones. Member Weronika Davel says she was also unemployed when she joined. She unknowingly violated the rules with her first request when she asked for a product: a computer because the CD player on hers had broken. Nevertheless, a bank member responded and gave her a used one. Davel says she later re-gifted it to a 13-year-old boy. "Later, I didn't need it because my parents gave me a gift, and so I could make some child happy, because he wanted to have a computer to play games and he was thrilled to have a new computer," Davel says. But she wanted to do more and began offering services of her own on the bank's website. "The main thing I really could offer was English, to study English," Davel explains. "Also, a young girl who makes massages, she needed translation, needed to have better English for her job." The site has many more offers of help than requests for it. That's as it should be, Kivi says, adding that the bigger reward comes from giving. [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
200804690	People tend to remember that the atomic bomb was developed at Los Alamos, N.M., and Oak Ridge, Tenn., but they often forget about a third nuclear production complex — the Hanford Site in Richland, Wash. It's where they built the world's first full-scale nuclear reactor. The "B Reactor" is a windowless, cinder block hulk out in the middle of nowhere. You might mistake it for an abandoned cement plant. But inside, it's a lovingly preserved time capsule of the Atomic Age. If you're lucky, your guide will be one of the people who worked here when the place was still new. Paul Vinther signed on at the plant in June 1950. He's a physicist, and his first job was helping to fine-tune the nuclear reaction that turned uranium into the highly radioactive plutonium that went into bombs, such as the one that fell on Nagasaki. He got here during Cold War, when B Reactor was churning out the raw material for America's growing nuclear arsenal. Vinther leads a tour group into the control room. The control room is very midcentury. It's government-issue green, with hundreds of analog gauges wired to the reactor core. No computers screens here. A vintage, hand-lettered sign warns against bumping into things. "Well, the idea is that if you bump it, you might cause the electrical connection of this thing to vibrate. It might activate. You don't want to shut the reaction down because you bumped it!" Vinther says. Did that ever happen? "It must have at one time because they wouldn't have said that," he says. "But people were very careful." Vinther seems torn: He knows tourists want tales of hair-raising near-misses. But he insists his co-workers did their jobs safely. Still, there's no getting around the fact that the potential danger is what makes this place interesting. It's a point made by the hacksaw hanging on the wall in front of the reactor itself. The hacksaw has a very long handle. "That shows when [people were] working on something hot that had to be cut, they could stand quite a distance away and still do the job," he says. "Hot" — as in radioactive. Sometimes tourists ask Vinther why he participated in the production of such frightening weapons. For him, it's simple: He says the A-bomb saved American lives. But when asked about all the radioactive waste produced here, he sighs. He calls it "a sad situation." "Here we were, worried about Germany and Japan, and then we worried about the Cold War situation with Russia," Vinther says. "The idea was, 'Well, we'll just put the waste into tanks, and we'll handle it later, when we have time.' " Later is now. Hanford no longer makes plutonium. The reactors that followed B have been shuttered and sealed up, and now the sprawling, 586-square-mile Hanford site has become synonymous with a giant remediation effort. Government contractors are billions of dollars into the process, with no end in sight. In fact, when it comes to cost and sheer technical complexity, the reactor is actually less impressive than the modern-day cleanup — and they offer tours of that, too. [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
203135843	South Carolina's highest court on Wednesday ruled that "Baby Veronica," the 3-year-old central figure in a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the Indian Child Welfare Act, should be returned to the white couple that agreed to adopt her before her birth, and not her Native American father, who later claimed his parental rights. Two years ago, the South Carolina Supreme Court had said that the 1978 federal law required that the young girl be removed from her adoptive parents — Matt and Melanie Capobianco — and sent to live with her biological father, Dusten Brown, a member of the Cherokee Nation living in Oklahoma. But Wednesday, it reversed itself, citing direction from the U.S. Supreme Court. Scotusblog's Lyle Denniston summarized the ruling. "Using the authority that the Supreme Court gave it three weeks ago, South Carolina's Supreme Court on Wednesday moved to put an end to a deeply emotional dispute over the custody of a child by ordering that she become a part of the family that fought to have her returned after eighteen months living with her father, a Cherokee Indian. In a three-to-two decision, the state court sent the case back to a family court with instructions to move swiftly to finalize the rights of the 'adoptive couple' to the child known as 'Baby Veronica.' She will be four on September 15." Last month, a divided U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Indian Child Welfare Act did not protect Brown's parental rights because he "abandoned the [American] Indian child before birth and never had custody of the child." In April, NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg summed up the emotional case this way: "Take the usual agony of an adoption dispute. Add in the disgraceful U.S. history of ripping Indian children from their Native American families. Mix in a dose of initial fatherly abandonment. And there you have it — a poisonous and painful legal cocktail that goes before the U.S. Supreme Court."  [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
203098437	Newspapers have done it. Magazines too. Now there's another very symbolic sign of how numbered the days seem to be for much of the "print" media: The University of Maryland's American Journalism Review "will end production of its print edition and launch a redesigned website in Fall 2013 as it becomes an online-only publication." "The model for publishing has clearly shifted to digital formats as online readership has grown," Dean Lucy A. Dalglish of the university's Philip Merrill College of Journalism says in a statement released with that announcement. "It no longer made financial sense for the award-winning AJR to continue producing a print magazine because most AJR readers accessed content on the Web," she adds. "In addition, philanthropy has long been an important source of funding for print magazines devoted to media criticism. That support has steadily declined over the past 10 years." AJR adds that: "The original Washington Journalism Review was founded in 1977 by American University graduate student Roger Kranz. In 1979 it was purchased by Ambassador Henry Catto and his wife, Jessica. WJR came to [the University of Maryland] in 1987 thanks to the efforts of then-Dean Reese Cleghorn. Just one year after Rem Rieder became editor in 1992, the publication was renamed the American Journalism Review. ... "Originally published 11 times per year with a large staff, it ultimately moved to three issues per year and in the last two years had an editor, part-time copy editor and free-lance writers and designers." Rieder left AJR in July to become an editor at USA Today. [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
203087104	"Senators have reached a bipartisan deal to restore lower interest rates on student borrowers," The Associated Press reports, citing "Republican and Democratic aides who insist on anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss the ongoing negotiations by name." According to the wire service, "the breakthrough came Wednesday, one day after lawmakers huddled with President Barack Obama at the White House. Lawmakers are expected to vote as early as Thursday on the deal that would lower rates before students return to campus." NBC News' Kelly O'Donnell tweets that there is a "framework of rates fix deal in place. Senators still negotiating lots of complicated details in package." Of that framework, the AP says: "Undergraduates last year borrowed at 3.4 percent or 6.8 percent, depending on their financial need. Graduate students had access to federal loans at 6.8 percent and parents borrowed at 7.9 percent. "Under the deal, all undergraduates this fall would borrow at 3.85 percent interest rates. Graduate students would have access to loans at 5.4 percent and parents would be able to borrow at 6.4 percent. "But if the economy improves as congressional economists predict, rates would climb in coming years. The compromise reached Wednesday evening would limit how high those rates could go, although all were higher than the current fixed levels." As NPR's Ailsa Chang has reported, House Republicans earlier passed their own student loan bill. It was the Democratic-controlled Senate that was hung up. But there was broad agreement that while rates shouldn't double, they did need to go up at least a bit and be tied to market rates. Along those lines, the Obama administration has proposed that loans be pegged to the 10-year Treasury rate, now about 2.5 percent. The administration's plan would have undergrads pay the 10-year Treasury rate plus 0.93 percentage points. The House plan would have undergrads pay 2.5 points more than then 10-year Treasury rate. There's a chart comparing the competing ideas here. [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
203087971	Monkey See contributor/longtime nerd Glen Weldon is headed to San Diego Comic-Con. He's filing periodic updates from one of the largest media events in the world. Glen and F's Apartment, Washington, DC. 4:00 a.m. ET: Alarm goes off. 4:05 a.m. ET: Alarm goes off. 4:10 a.m. ET: Alarm is like, "Hey. HEY. HEY JERK." 4:11 a.m. ET: Arise, grudgingly. Shower, grudgingly. Get dressed, grudgingly. You know what? It's 4:11in the morning, so you can pretty much just add ", grudgingly" to the end of every sentence from here on. It'll save me a little time. 4:25 a.m. ET: Final check before getting in cab. Laptop? Check. Tablet? Check. Phone? Check. Digital voice recorder? Check. Cords to connect the above to one another in various Byzantine ways? Check. Chargers for all of the above? Check. Backup chargers? Check. Backup to the backup chargers? Check. Clothestoiletriesshoesblahblahboringtravelstuffwhatever? Check. Bag full of pointy, pointy lapel buttons? ... Check? Well, of course that's the question of the whole morning. Do I check these buttons, or can I carry them on the plane? A bit of background: I am flying to San Diego Comic-Con for the first time. I have attended several comics conventions, but nothing like the sprawling 130,000-plus-attendee transmedia cross-platform clusterfest of hypermegalosynergistic promotion that awaits me at the San Diego Convention Center. For the past few months I've been nervously joking with SDCC veterans: "It's pretty much like the Small Press Expo (an annual gathering of indie/art-comix creators and devotees I've attended for years), right? A bunch of beardy, fixie-bike guys and eye-linered Betty Page girls talking soberly about the linework of Tony Millionaire and Kolbein Karlsson, right?" Wrong. "You'll see," they say, and sink into a reverie, gazing fixedly into the middle distance like a hard-bitten 'Nam vet at an American Legion spaghetti dinner. My habit, when going to conventions (and when going, you know, anywhere) is to hang back and observe. And were this any other year, and any other convention, I'd probably stick to that plan. But there are a few things that are forcing me out of my shell and into the Great Nerdy Scrum of Humanity, Robotity and Ewokity. 1. I've got a book to shill, and where better to shill it than Shill Central, the Great Geek Shillodrome, The Big Shill, Shillapalooza? My book, Superman: The Unauthorized Biography, came out in April, and sales have been neither underwhelming nor overwhelming. They are, instead, whelming: plainly, resolutely and unremarkably whelming. This year is Superman's 75th anniversary. I'd applied for an official SDCC panel with Brad Ricca, author of the great new book Super Boys (a beautifully written bio of Superman's creators Siegel and Shuster and their legal and financial struggles with DC Comics), and Mark Waid (legendary comic book writer, editor, and Superman expert non-pareil), but we were rejected. This year, the only Superman celebrations at SDCC are hosted by his corporate overlords, DC Comics. More on this later. Without a pre-set place and time to hawk the book, my original plan to send a bunch of copies to the hotel doesn't make much sense. Can't imagine I'll find a lot of opportunities for ad-hoc book-hawking, or — given that I won't have any hard copies on hand — many takers. I am great at marketing. 2. I've got a book to research. My next book is about the rise of nerd culture, and Comic-Con is nerd culture in ... it feels funny to use the term "microcosm" when speaking of this particular media event, but there you go. My plan is to comb the con floor and stalk the panel discussions looking for SDCC long-timers to interview, folks who have seen the show metastasize from what it was in 1970 — an opportunity for 300 fans to paw through some back issue bins in a hotel ballroom and meet Jack Kirby and Ray Bradbury — to what it is today. 3. You, dear reader. I'm hoping that all that aforementioned research will help me bring a wider historical context to my coverage of the con for NPR. Oh, there'll be photos of cosplayers, never fear. Trust me, I'll be the Tom Joad of hot dudes in spandex. ("Wherever there is a bare-chested Hawkman, you will find me... Wherever there is Kraven the Hunter, I'll be there.") And I'll try to provide a sense of the upcoming movies and shows that people on the floor are excited about. But you can get that kind of coverage anywhere. What I'll look for, in this diary, is the scrappy little comic book convention hidden inside the exultant corporate branding workshop that is Comic-Con. I'll be asking people I meet what books they love that not enough people know about. I hope to come away from the next four days with a list of books and series to get excited about. 4. It's maybe time to get over my damn self already. I've gotten to be Twitter-friendly with several people who'll be at SDCC, and I hope — in stark defiance of my ingrained, muscular, weaponized form of introversion — to meet them in person, and buy them a beer or six. (Also: The great and good Maggie Thompson, who with her husband Don gave birth to comic-book fandom [and also gave birth to NPR Music's own Stephen Thompson, for their sins] has offered to be a voluble, wise and extremely well-connected Virgil to my squirrelly, hyperventilating Dante. She's also invited me as her +1 to the Eisner Awards on Friday night, where the comics industry honors its own.) To force myself to engage with others while I'm at SDCC, I've decided to take two hundred or so Pop Culture Happy Hour ... buttons? Lapel pins? You know those metal dealies you stuck to your backpack, back in the day? Those. I'll hand them out – A CON EXCLUSIVE!!! (say, maybe I'm good at marketing after all?) – like Johnny Frickin' Buttonseed. Which brings me back to the dilemma that faces me now, at ... 4:45 a.m. ET: These buttons are awfully pointy. They're basically 200 elaborately decorated needles. Or if you prefer: 200 tiny, tiny pikes that may not, given their size, be considered "deadly." "Ouchy"? Oh my yes. "Deadly?" No. So: Can I carry them on the plane? We're really really trying not to check any luggage. The thought of waiting at a baggage carousel for a bunch of lapel pins fills me with a very specific form of sadness which is only the latest aspect of my life that would be impossible to explain to my grandparents. Last night we asked Twitter what to do. Twitter said, "That would raise eyebrows!" Twitter said "Don't risk it." Twitter said "Mail them to your hotel room!" Twitter worries a lot. We called the airline. "Put them in a clear plastic baggie, and have it go through the x-ray machine alone," the airline said. "Should be fine." But then, the airline also said the plane will be on time. So. I mean. Pound of salt, you know? Regardless! We're taking them in a carry on bag! Because we're LIVIN' ON THE EDGE! 4:50 a.m ET: Walk the dog, who'll have a longish wait until the dogsitter comes. The dog attends to his morning ablutions. Groggily. Grudgingly. You and me both, pal. 5:15 a.m. ET: In the cab! On the way to Comic-Con! Wooo! Flight's not till 6:30! Plenty of time! Using the boarding pass app on our phones! Wooo! 5:25 a.m. ET: HOLY CRAP I LEFT MY I.D. BACK AT THE APARTMENT TURN THE CAB AROUND WE HAVE TO GO BACK OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD 5:35 a.m. ET: WHY ARE THE TRAFFIC LIGHTS SO LONG AT THIS TIME OF THE MORNING THERE'S ONLY LIKE MILKMEN ON THE ROADS RIGHT? YES THERE ARE SO STILL MILKMEN AROUND SHUT UP. 5:40 a.m. ET: OKAY WE GOT IT. Now please hurry. It's going to be tight. 6:00 a.m. ET: Airport. More anxiety: I watch the bag of Pop Culture Happy Hour lapel pins disappear into the maw of the x-ray machine to bathe in roentgens – and in the baleful gaze of a security professionals. 6:15 a.m. ET: The gods are merciful, and brand-conscious, this day. The PCHH pins make it through. 6:20 a.m. ET: As we board, I inspect my fellow passengers, expecting to catch knowing looks from fellow members of my nerdy tribe. .... Nope. This flight doesn't go straight to San Diego, though. We're going to change planes in Minneapolis. Nobody looks like they're SDCC-bound. Unless they're cosplaying as Jim Gaffigan. 9:15 a.m. ET: Leaving Minneapolis; headed to San Diego. If we stay on time, we should arrive at 11:00 a.m. Pacific Time. We will head to the hotel, where F will meet some friends from Miami, and do outdoorsy vacation-type things in San Diego, the chump. I, on the other hand, will coordinate with Maggie, head to the Convention Center, get my press pass and wait in line for the floor to open for "Preview Night" at 6:00 p.m. I look around the plane. Okay. HERE's my people: Two young women ahead of us carry Doctor Who Cabbage Patch Dolls (Four and Eleven, for the nerds among you) as they chat animatedly about Batroc the Leaper. Across the aisle, a lean and hungry dude clutches his portfolio worriedly. The six-year-old behind me ticks off the Thursday schedule for Hall H from memory. The floor won't open for hours. But Comic-Con has begun. [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
203016331	In late July 1973, Joseph Crachiola was wandering the streets of Mount Clemens, Mich.,, a suburb of Detroit, with his camera. As a staff photographer for the Macomb Daily, he was expected to keep an eye out for good feature images — "those little slices of life that can stand on their own." The slice of life he caught that day was a picture of five young friends in a rain-washed alley in downtown Mount Clemens. And what distinguishes it are its subjects: three black children, two white ones, giggling in each others' arms. "It was just one of those evenings," Crachiola remembers. "I saw these kids — they were just playing around. And I started shooting some pictures of them. At some point, they saw me and they all turned and looked at me and struck that pose that you see in the picture. It was totally spontaneous. I had nothing to do with the way they arranged themselves." This week, Crachiola, who now lives in New Orleans, posted the vintage photo on his Facebook page. "For me, it still stands as one of my most meaningful pictures," he wrote in his post. "It makes me wonder... At what point do we begin to mistrust one another? When do we begin to judge one another based on gender or race? I have always wondered what happened to these children. I wonder if they are still friends." After several days when the world seemed to be reduced to one big argument about race, the elegantly simple photo hit a nerve — in a good way. After his Sunday post, Crachiola's Facebook page blew up — as many as 100,000 page views. Six thousand "likes" and thousands of shares. The Macomb Daily reprinted the photo on its Web page and sent someone to the archives to help identify the children, who are now middle-aged. It's hard not to smile while looking at this picture. Crachiola liked it so much himself that he printed a large copy and has it hanging in his dining room. Former Michigan Rep. Don Riegle reportedly also liked it so much, he got a framed copy and hung it in his office. Crachiola says that learning of the verdict in the George Zimmerman trial reminded him of the photo and made him think to post it. He's been gratified by the response. Between Facebook and the newspaper, he has solid leads on where the children are today. "Someone emailed me saying he works with one of the guys who was in the picture," Crachiola says. "He actually works for the Macomb County Road Commission." And just before we spoke, Crachiola saw someone had posted an even more intriguing note: "This," wrote Darnesha Taylor Shelly, "is my husband and sister in laws." Looks like a reunion might be imminent. [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
203067633	Senator Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., sent a shudder through the Olympic world Wednesday when he told American Olympic network NBC that the United States should consider boycotting the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics if Russia grants the asylum request of "NSA leaker" Edward Snowden. "I love the Olympics but I hate what the Russian government is doing throughout the world," Graham told NBC. "If they give asylum to a person who I believe has committed treason against the United States, that's taking it to a new level." An American boycott of the $52 billion Sochi games would diminish the symbolic power of the world's biggest sporting event. Graham apparently sees a boycott as a threat Russian President Vladimir Putin could not ignore. Graham even threw in a comparison to the 1936 Berlin Olympics that Adolf Hitler promoted as a demonstration of Aryan superiority. "If you could go back in time, would you have allowed Adolf Hitler to host the Olympics in Germany?" Graham asked, referring to the Berlin games as a "propaganda coup." "I'm not saying that Russia is Nazi Germany," Graham added, "but I am saying that the Russian government is empowering some of the most evil, hateful people in the world." Some argue that the success of American athletes in Berlin, especially sprinter and long-jumper Jesse Owens, robbed Hitler of the propaganda value he sought. Owens, an African-American, won four gold medals, an Olympic track and field record for Americans unequaled for close to 50 years. The U.S. Olympic Committee responded to Graham with a history lesson of its own. "Olympic boycotts do not work," says Patrick Sandusky, the spokesman for the USOC, in reference to the American boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. The boycott was one way President Jimmy Carter protested the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. "Our boycott of the 1980 Olympic Games did not contribute to a successful resolution of the underlying conflict," Sandusky adds. "It did, however, deprive hundreds of American athletes, all of whom had completely dedicated themselves to representing our nation at the Olympic Games, of the opportunity of a lifetime." The International Olympic Committee had nothing to add, except to note that "at this stage it is no more than a hypothetical," according to IOC spokesman Mark Adams. Russian officials sharply criticized Graham's boycott suggestion, according to aroundtherings.com (ATR), an independent Olympic news service. ATR quotes Russian senator Ruslan Gattarov, who says that Graham's statements show that "in the international arena, when the United States can't use its army and navy to strike at a country directly, it starts issuing political statements that belittle itself." Shamil Tarpischev, a Russian member of the International Olympic Committee, dismissed Graham's remarks as "tabloid chatter and an attempt to attract attention and show off," ATR reports. Some of Graham's Republican congressional colleagues quickly dismissed any suggestion of an Olympic boycott. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who has criticized and scrutinized Olympic corruption and spending, told The Hill that: "There's many things we can do, but I think the experience of canceling the Olympics the last time around wasn't very good." And House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, called the boycott talk "dead wrong." At a news conference, he asked: "Why would we want to punish U.S. athletes who've been training for three years to compete in the Olympics over a traitor who can't find a place to call home?" The 1980 Moscow boycott prompted Soviet retaliation four years later when Los Angeles hosted the 1984 Olympics. Soviet athletes stayed home. Olympic athletes and officials denounced the "politicization" of the games. American Olympic medalist Allison Baver tells NPR that "the concept of boycotting the Olympics has become slightly outdated." Baver is a short track speed skater and is training hard for Sochi. She's "not taking this issue lightly," Baver adds, in referring to Snowden's leaks of intelligence information. But, "I believe it's important for political figures to respect the grounds upon which Olympians compete. The Olympics has the power to unite mankind through one commonality — sport."

203014436	San Diego voters knew that Bob Filner could act like a jerk on occasion. But in 2012, they elected him mayor anyway. Now, though, Filner's behavior may have crossed a threshold that few politicians can recover from. The Democrat is facing numerous accusations of sexual harassment, and growing calls for him to step down from office. At a press conference on Monday, attorneys Marco Gonzalez, Cory Briggs and former council member Donna Frye — all former Filner supporters — revealed the details of the allegations from three women who wish to remain anonymous. According to statements from the women, one campaign volunteer said the mayor "[jammed] his tongue down her throat" and groped her; a constituent said that he kissed her and asked her on a date; a staffer said that he "grabbed her ass and touched her chest." The women described a "Filner dance" they invented to avoid his advances and the "Filner headlock" he would put them in. According to Gonzalez, the mayor said things like, "They would do a better job on that floor if they worked without their panties on." Just when it seemed it couldn't get worse, Filner's former fiancee, Bronwyn Ingram, came forward with the reasoning for their split after realizing an email she sent to one of Filner's security personnel would be released via a public records request. "Bob's constant infidelities which are being flaunted in my face lately along with his abusiveness and disrespect has become absolutely intolerable," she wrote in the email. In a statement to KPBS, Ingram asked him to resign. "Bob's behavior continued to become more aggressive; standard decorum seemed to disappear," she stated. "Bob recently began texting other women sexually explicit messages and setting up dates while in my presence and within my line of vision." Ingram isn't the only one who thinks he should step down. So do several City Council members and local members of Congress. They're joined by the San Diego National Organization for Women. And the results of a SurveyUSA poll from Friday say 59 percent of San Diego voters think the mayor should go. In response to the initial allegations, Filner didn't deny any of the incidents. He released a video last week apologizing: "I've reached into my heart and soul and realized that I must and will change my behavior. ... I am also humble to admit that I need help. I have begun to work with professionals to make changes in my behavior and approach." He has since hired an attorney, Harvey Berger, and made Walt Ekard interim chief operating officer. Filner's abrasive personality has gotten him in trouble in the past. In 2007, an airport employee claimed in a criminal complaint that Filner, then a congressman, screamed at and pushed her. The House Ethics Committee ultimately dropped the investigation, although Filner had to pay $100 and send an apology letter. The incident became grist for an emotional 2012 attack ad by Filner's Republican opponent, Carl Demaio, which featured the airport employee recounting how she would "never forget he told me 'you can't stop me.' " The San Diego County Democratic leadership, whose central committee is made up of around 60 members, will meet Thursday evening to determine an official response. Filner, who has refused to resign and insists he is innocent of sexual harassment, has been invited to attend. [Copyright 2013 NPR]

203030968	In an interview this week, Univision's Adriana Vargas asked President Obama if, in the event Congress failed to pass immigration legislation, he could simply use his presidential power to give amnesty to the estimated 11 million people currently in the U.S. illegally. The president didn't exactly shut the door on that possibility, though he did strongly suggest it was a portal he'd rather not go through. OBAMA: "Probably not. I think that it is very important for us to recognize that the way to solve this problem has to be legislative. I can do some things and have done some things that make a difference in the lives of people by determining how our enforcement should focus. Right now we're focused much more on criminals. We're focused much more on those who have endangered people or communities. And we've been able to provide help through deferred action for young people and students — the DREAMers who I've had a chance to meet with. And they're just incredible young people and great assets to the United States. But this is a problem that needs to be fixed legislatively. So I'm not going to speculate on the House bill failing. I'm going to make sure that I do everything I can to help it succeed." "Probably not" is obviously not the same as "no" or "never." So Obama seems to be keeping the option available to himself even as he puts the onus on Congress to achieve an immigration overhaul that includes a path to citizenship, known to its detractors as "amnesty." And it is a very real, if highly unlikely, option for the president. Article 2, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution gives the president broad pardon powers, even to the extent of granting amnesties to those who've violated federal law. Amnesty dates to the earliest days of the republic. Like many presidential traditions, it began with President George Washington, who offered an amnesty to participants in 1794's Whiskey Rebellion, a violent tax revolt in Western Pennsylvania. More recently, Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter gave amnesties to Vietnam War-era draft evaders. "The constitutional backdrop is [that there is] absolutely no doubt the president could [declare an amnesty for those in the country illegally]," P.S. Ruckman Jr., a professor of Rock Valley College in Illinois, told me in an interview. Ruckman, an expert on presidential pardons who runs the Pardon Power blog, said: "I don't think there's anyone who would argue the president doesn't have that power. I can't imagine who that would be or what their argument would be ..." But just because the president has the constitutional power to do something doesn't mean it would be a politically wise move. "Sure, if you're the president, you would probably prefer that the legislative branch solve this," Ruckman said. "Legislation can be a little more detailed. It can be, at least potentially, the work of compromise and potentially bipartisan. "So if you're the president, sure, that's the ideal way to do it," Ruckman said. "Also, if you're the president you don't want to send signals that you're kind of trigger happy. 'Well, hey if Congress doesn't do it, then I'll grant the amnesty.' You can't do that. So [what Obama said to Univision was] exactly what the president should say. But it doesn't alleviate the fact that he does have the power, ultimately." Unilaterally granting a presidential amnesty to people in the country illegally would not only be received as a declaration of war by many of his Republican opponents; it most likely wouldn't go down well even with some Democratic allies. "This is one of the great lessons of Woodrow Wilson's presidency," Ruckman said. "There's party politics and ideological politics, which we're all aware of. But there's also institutional politics. And Wilson just had a way of annoying people in his own party in the Senate. He made them feel like they weren't significant. "And the next thing you know, he lost them as allies. I think if you're in the House and the Senate, you don't want the president, even if you're in his party, out there flexing amnesty muscle. Now the time may come when he will do it. It's certainly constitutional. But there's no reason to preview it at all now. None." [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
201501977	Dear Salt, I recently joined President Obama on his trip through Africa, and I brought a mystery home with me. I wonder if you can help me solve it. I was supposed to take my anti-malaria pills in the morning, with heavy or fatty food. That meant a lot of eggs for breakfast, all across Africa. In Senegal and South Africa, everything seemed normal. Then we arrived at the final stop of the trip, in Tanzania. When I picked up my vegetable omelet from the breakfast buffet at my hotel in Dar es Salaam, one glance suggested they'd accidentally made an egg white omelet. No big deal. I ate it without a second thought. The next day, President Obama flew home, and I went to a remote island called Mafia for 36 hours of R&R. My first morning at the rustic lodge, I ordered scrambled eggs. They, too, were white. Could this chef have left out the yolks, too? Impossible. The next day, determined to get to the bottom of this, I ordered my eggs sunny-side-up. (Not my favorite, but a sacrifice I was willing to make in the name of scientific research.) Sure enough, the runny yolks were ghostly pale. I asked the lodge manager, who'd lived in South Africa and England, why the yolks looked more like whites. "Oh, those eggs you get in the U.S. are only yellow because they're pumped full of hormones," he said. But I know that's not true; I buy my eggs from my neighborhood farmers market, and the yolks are the color of a setting sun. Could the color of the yolks have something to do with what the chickens are eating, or with the breed of chicken that lays them? I know that some chickens produce eggshells in shades of blue, pink, yellow or brown. Maybe the yolk color varies just as widely? But does that explain why the eggs were pale in both a Dar es Salaam chain hotel and a remote Mafia lodge? Can you help me unscramble this puzzle?   Yours, Ari Dear Ari, White egg yolks may look bizarre, but poultry scientists I spoke with say there's nothing to worry about. "I get that call every once in a while: 'My [yolks] are freakishly pale!' " says Scott Beyer, a poultry specialist with the state of Kansas. As you suspected, the reason Americans eggs tend to have bright yellow yolks has nothing to do with "hormones" but rather with what we feed our hens. Beyer says egg yolk color is almost entirely influenced by the birds' diet. So if you're feeding birds yellow corn, "it gets in the egg," he explains. "But if you had a situation where you're feeding birds white corn, then the egg yolk could be white." The yellow color in egg yolks, as well yellowish chicken skin and fat, comes from pigments found in plants called xanthophylls, primarily lutein, notes Han Jianlin, a geneticist at the International Livestock Research Institute. In most parts of the world, he says, diners prefer their yolks with a sunnier disposition, so commercial feeds often contain lutein as an additive, though yellow maize, soybeans, carrots and alfafa powder will also do the trick. Sorghum – a grain with much less pigmentation than yellow maize — is used as chicken feed in Tanzania, which probably explains the pallid omelets you encountered. On the other end of the rainbow, says Beyer, are the yolks in some parts of South America, where hens will peck at bright red annatto seeds. The result? Brilliant yolks ranging from dark orange to red orange to pink, Beyer says.  Many egg eaters assume that darker yolks are a sign of higher nutritional value, but both Beyer and Jianlin independently told me that's not the case at all. Although chicken feed does influence the nutritional value of birds and their eggs, the researchers say yolk color won't tell you anything. -- Maria [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
203045938	If you've seen stories in the past few days about Cleveland's Charles Ramsey supposedly being out of work, broke and homeless, then you'll want to read this update that has word from the man himself: "Charles Ramsey, the man who helped to rescue Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight from captivity, says a news report by Britain's Daily Mail is 'full of lies,' " Cleveland's WKYC-TV writes. The station adds that: " 'It's bulls**t,' he said. 'That's the politically correct word for it.' He said he's made about $18,000 from his sudden fame. ... Ramsey insisted that he's not homeless. He said he moved out of his Seymour Avenue home because too many people were knocking on his door. In the meantime, he's staying with friends and family until he can find an apartment. He's hoping to start an online business, selling merchandise in his likeness. His website, CharlesRamseyLive.com, is currently under construction." Meanwhile, as The Plain Dealer reports, the man who's accused of holding captive three young women (and a daughter born to one of them) for about a decade "pleaded not guilty Wednesday morning to a 977-count indictment." The charges against Ariel Castro include kidnapping, rape, child endangerment and aggravated murder (for torture that allegedly caused one of the women to suffer miscarriages). Ramsey gained quick fame after the women were rescued on May 6. His animated descriptions of Amanda Berry's struggle to escape the house and his efforts to help her went viral. Last week, as we reported, the young women released a thank you video. [Copyright 2013 NPR]

203019606	Sometimes, the most important musicians are the ones farthest away from the spotlight. Laurie Frink was a great trumpet player. Great enough to tour with jazz big bands led by Benny Goodman, Gerry Mulligan (where she played lead) and Maria Schneider; to be one of the first female trumpet players on the Broadway pit orchestra circuit in New York. As a freelancer, she was known for her ability to execute just about anything, no matter the level of difficulty. Jazz trumpeter John McNeil first met Frink decades ago in a rock club. A week later, she showed up to a big band rehearsal he was attending. "What she did, just for entertainment: She proceeded to play some of the warhorses of classical trumpet literature, like the Hummel Concerto and some of these others that everybody knows," McNeil says. "But she played them at light speed. It was the funniest thing I ever heard in my life — it sounded like a wind-up toy, or something played like a 33 [RPM vinyl] disc played on 78 [RPM], you know? It was hilarious — it sounded like a chipmunk playing trumpet. ... But I started thinking to myself as she's doing that, 'Yeah, that's pretty funny, but Jesus Christ, she's actually able to do that.'" Though rarely an enthusiastic bandleader, Frink made a lot of bands sound good. But she was better known as someone who made a lot of other brass players sound better. For the last 25-odd years, Laurie Frink was the go-to brass instructor in New York City, especially for improvising musicians. In addition to her private studio and online video-chat lessons, she was on faculty at three New York City universities — NYU, the New School, Manhattan School of Music — and the New England Conservatory. She attracted students from around the world. Her method came from Carmine Caruso, a famed brass guru and one of her own teachers. Caruso was a saxophonist by trade, but his particular method of technique exercises, paired with personable coaching, made him a revered instructor. After Caruso, she started teaching more heavily, based on his method. This meant she worked personally with students on how to practice, often designing custom exercises with her students based on their goals. She would go so far as to regularly attend her students' gigs in order to better understand specifically what they wanted to work on. Those students included many of the top jazz musicians in New York — players like Dave Douglas. "Technique, people think of as being something really cold," Douglas says. "And there was something very warm about the way Laurie understood how to talk to people. Some people refer to her as their 'trumpet mother,' because a session with her was part psychotherapy, part cheering section and part, 'Let's figure out the trumpet.'" On the morning he was recording his second album with the Tiny Bell Trio, Douglas was having issues with his "chops" — his ability to execute. He was in Zurich, Switzerland, and placed a desperate call to Frink in New York. "It must have been 6 in the morning in New York," Douglas says. "I left a message on her machine. I just said, 'This is crazy, but I'm in Zurich, and here's what's happening, and I'm really freaking out. Here's the hotel number, and if you happen to get the chance to call me, I'll be here for another hour or so.' This is before cell phones. "Sure enough, the phone rings in 15 minutes. And I'm like, 'Oh, thank you so much for calling!' She goes, 'Shut up, put the phone down, and play this for me.' So I play it, and I pick up the phone, and she goes, "OK, now play this.' I play it, pick the phone back up, and she says, "OK, I've got three exercises for you. You got a pencil and paper?' So I wrote down the exercises, did 'em and you can listen to the record. ... She saved me." With fellow Caruso student John McNeil, Frink wrote Flexus, a book of "trumpet calisthenics" designed to improve physical facility specifically for improvisers. This came about after she helped McNeil completely relearn how to play the instrument — twice — when a degenerative disease left him with limited muscle control. "If it weren't for her teaching me how to be as efficient as possible, I wouldn't be playing today," McNeil says. "Absolutely not — I just wouldn't be able to." Thousands of musicians sing her praises. "R.I.P MS Laurie Frink - changed my life !!" posted trumpeter Ambrose Akinmusire on Twitter. In a heartfelt essay, another trumpeter, Nadje Noordhuis, reflected on Frink's friendship and inspiration. One time, I wrote that I was having a bad day. Within half an hour, she had emailed me a picture of herself in a hilarious costume. It was so unbelievably funny that I laughed uncontrollably for about half an hour. I'm laughing through my tears right now just thinking of it. Though Frink dedicated her career to serving others without expectation of recognition, the Festival of New Trumpet Music, a nonprofit group which puts on trumpet-led concerts, feted her with a lifetime achievement award last year. Her student Jon Crowley wrote about the experience. She sat in the back, uncomfortable with being the center of attention. ... There was a great photo montage of her giving the middle finger to the camera in various places, her sense of humor was another reason we all loved her. She got up at the very end when she was finally forced to talk and just said "This has been great, it's like being able to attend your own funeral and hear all the nice things people say about you!" It was a good night for close friends to thank Laurie for what she's given to us and for her friendship. I know it meant a lot to her. Crowley never got to see her again. Laurie Frink died July 13 from lingering complications of bile duct cancer, according to her longtime partner Lois Martin. She was 62. But for Crowley and other brass players, she remains with them in spirit. Long after her lessons, many of her students still do the exercises she designed specifically for them every day.

202979220	Blackfish, a movie opening Friday in New York and Los Angeles, takes aim squarely at theme parks like SeaWorld where captive dolphins, including orcas or killer whales, perform in entertainment shows for the public. "Nothing at [SeaWorld] is what it seems," Blackfish director Gabriela Cowperthwaite has said, as reported in The Boston Globe. I have not yet seen the film, which goes to wide release in subsequent weeks and will air this fall on CNN. Judging from the trailer and other advance material, Blackfish focuses heavily on the 2010 death of SeaWorld-Orlando trainer Dawn Brancheau caused by the orca called Tilikum. Blackfish claims that the psychological stress of captivity and being made to perform caused Tilikum (and other cetaceans as well) such stress that severe trauma and aggression is the result. For its part, SeaWorld released a statement on Saturday calling Blackfish "shamefully dishonest, deliberately misleading, and scientifically inaccurate." SeaWorld made a case against the film in a series of 8 points, and the filmmakers have responded. Last year at 13.7, I wrote about another incident, this time at SeaWorld-San Diego in 2006, in which an orca named Kasatka pulled trainer Ken Peters under the water repeatedly (Peters survived). For that post, I turned to David Kirby's book Death At SeaWorld, and this week I invited Kirby to participate in a Q&A with me about Blackfish. Our exchange, which was conducted by email, went like this. Barbara: What impact do you hope Blackfish will have on the movie-going public? David: I hope it will make movie-goers think; though how you could leave the theater without thinking about the plight of captive orcas is beyond me. This movie — and this terrible saga of marine mammal display — makes us question and judge ourselves, as humans and consumers of entertainment. The verdict is still out on us, but Blackfish presents its evidence powerfully and wrenchingly. Many people are on the fence about killer whale captivity — they won't be after seeing this movie. Barbara: Can you help us make sense of the debate between SeaWorld and the makers of Blackfish about the accuracy of the movie's content? David: It was one of the clumsiest, most ill-advised acts of corporate crisis-management [by SeaWorld] I've seen in decades — think New Coke — and it's driving ticket sales, and sales of my book, so it already backfired. SeaWorld listed 8 complaints, all of them easily disputable. It suggested, among other things, that orcas live as long in captivity as the wild — false; that SeaWorld orcas are not bullied by tank-mates — false; that SeaWorld orca families are not broken up unnecessarily — false; and that trainers were warned about the dark history of Tilikum, who did not "attack" Dawn Brancheau when he killed her — false and patently false. I wrote my own rebuttal [available online]. Barbara: The stance taken in your book and also in the movie is a strong one against SeaWorld. Do you believe that the public is beginning, or will begin, to look differently at SeaWorld and similar cetacean parks? David: My book is not against SeaWorld, nor is Blackfish, per se. The message is against keeping killer whales in captivity, wherever they are held. SeaWorld does do work with animal rescue, conservation, and outreach to local schools, though contributions to science and to the education of park guests are meager, at best. But the public is getting the message that captivity is wrong, and Blackfish will really help. Besides, SeaWorld can survive and thrive without live whales and dolphins. Look at the hugely popular Monterrey Aquarium in California: Not a cetacean in sight, by design. It's a good point that David makes: For theme parks, certainly, not a cetacean in sight, by design, is the desirable wave of the future. Barbara's new book is How Animals Grieve.

202661676	This is a big year for mayor's races. And it was supposed to be "the year of the woman" for mayoral candidates. When 2013 began, there was a fair amount of hope that women could make up for their relatively measly representation in local offices nationwide by capturing the mayoralty in three of the nation's five largest cities. Houston Mayor Annise Parker still looks like a good bet for re-election, but New York City Council Speaker Christine Quinn has slipped in polls behind former Rep. Anthony Weiner in the race to replace Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Quinn still has a chance, but out in Los Angeles, onetime front-runner Wendy Greuel lost the mayor's race in May. "Progress has been slow," says Nichole Bauer, who is writing a dissertation on women and politics at Indiana University. In all the U.S. cities with populations above 30,000, only 17 percent have women serving as mayor. EMILY's List, the political action committee that seeks to elect women who are pro-abortion rights, hopes to change that. The PAC, which has declared 2013 to be the "year of the woman mayor," has provided support to eight mayoral candidates thus far. "It's about building the pipeline, getting women to run for local offices because we know they'll run for higher office," says Marcy Stech, the group's press secretary. So far, though, it's been tough getting anywhere near proportional representation for women in city halls. Women are already serving as mayor in Baltimore, Fresno, Las Vegas and Fort Worth — but, along with Houston, those are the only ones with populations above 500,000. "It's encouraging that there are so many women running for mayor around the country, but there's still not equality there," says Mary Ann Lutz, the mayor of Monrovia, Calif. Betsy Hodges, a member of the City Council, remains in contention in Minneapolis, but beyond that the races where women are favored or have a strong chance are taking place in relatively smaller cities such as Dayton, Ohio; Syracuse, N.Y.; and Tacoma, Wash. The low number of female mayors nationwide roughly tracks with the percentage of women holding other offices. Women make up 18 percent of the House and 20 percent of the Senate — despite record gains in 2012. They've made up 20 to 24 percent of state legislators for the past two decades. Lutz says that voters still expect women to concentrate on education and health care — "quote, unquote, women's issues," she says. As a result, many female candidates will consciously adopt a strategy of talking more about matters such as crime and financial matters. "Sometimes women get painted unfairly with the brush of unfettered compassion over concern with law and order," says Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake. Female mayors and their champions such as Stech say that women are less likely to engage in partisan gamesmanship than men and more willing to compromise. That's presented as a plus, but it may not come across as such to voters, says Bauer, who says that voters often picture women as not being as "decisive and aggressive" as they want leaders to be. Political science research has also shown that successful women in careers such as the law are much less likely than men to consider careers in politics in the first place. "Men over the years have developed better networking, going back to the expression 'good ol' boys,'" says Lori Moseley, the mayor of Miramar, Fla. But she says the increasing number of women running for local office provides a way of changing all that. "We're going to continue to be a force to be reckoned with," she says. "You have to know we're not going to accept anything else." [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
203000826	China has by far the most Internet users in the world, and it appears that soon half the country will be on the Web, thanks largely to cellphones and other mobile devices. In percentage terms, Iceland, Norway and Sweden have the highest Internet penetration, with more than 90 percent of residents online. The U.S. is 27th, with 78 percent of Americans online. But in new data released Wednesday, the China Internet Network Information Center announced that 591 million people in China had used the Internet as of June 2013. That's 44 percent of the country's 1.3 billion population. Much of the growth can be attributed to wireless devices. The following two charts show the Internet's growth in China and its penetration rate. In the past, critics have disputed some of the numbers coming. They acknowledge that China is indeed one of the world's largest Internet markets, but question just how big it is or the methodology used to come up with some of the data. [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
202957246	The environment may not come to mind when most people think about former President Bill Clinton, but on Wednesday he defended his legacy as the Environmental Protection Agency's headquarters in Washington, D.C., was renamed in his honor. At a ceremony in the EPA complex, Clinton mentioned reading an article that questioned whether his was the right name to put on the building. "I think it more than sort of fits — not for me, but for what we did. For what our administration did," Clinton said in remarks greeted by applause from a small crowd that included senators, a congressman and former members of his administration. Clinton cited actions his administration took that protected wild lands, coral reefs and old growth trees. He stressed that his EPA put in place rules to clean up exhaust from factories and vehicles and set the first air quality standards for soot. "When I left office, there were 43 million more Americans breathing air that met federal standards, which means less asthma among young people and fewer senior citizens dying because of air pollution," Clinton said. The former president credited the environmentalists on his team, including his Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, his EPA chief Carol Browner and his vice president, Al Gore (who was not among those at Wednesday's ceremony). Judith Layzer, associate professor of environmental policy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says that unlike Gore, President Clinton wasn't an environmentalist. But she says he stood up for the EPA in 1994. Congressional Republicans, led by Newt Gingrich, wanted to eliminate regulations. Some wanted to do away with the agency. "Instead of backing down — the way liberals often do and the way environmentalists sometimes do and the way Clinton sometimes did — he really reared up and said, you know, we are going to protect environmental laws we are not going to let Congress gut them," says Layzer. But Clinton's record didn't please all those who consider themselves to be environmentalists. He supported trade deals, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement that were criticized for hurting the environment. Environmentalists feared factories would move to countries without pollution laws, and polluting industries would set up just across the border with Mexico. And although Clinton signed the international climate change treaty called the Kyoto Protocol, he failed to send it to Congress to be ratified. In his speech Wednesday, Clinton mentioned that the Senate had made its opposition to the treaty clear to him. "It is the only bill I ever lost in Congress before I sent it to them, and an astonishing example of bipartisan cooperation in the Senate, which voted against it 98 to nothing," Clinton said. The building that's been renamed after President Clinton is one of a string of imposing structures with limestone facades near the National Mall. It sits next to the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center. Clinton accepted his new honor in an ornate hall — with elaborately carved wooden ceiling and walls and crystal chandelier. The former president also looked ahead during his remarks, saying that as he travels the world as an elder statesman, it is clear to him that these days leaders no longer have the option of ignoring climate change if they want to build jobs and strong economies. "That is what the whole 21st century world is going to be about," he said. [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
203018637	Ruby Keeler was an unknown actress when she starred in the 1933 production of Busby Berkeley's 42nd Street. But the movie was so popular she was able to land two more splashy musicals that same year — and seven more by the end of the decade. There was nothing extraordinary about her talents as a vocalist or as an actress, but audiences of the Depression era really bought into Keeler's "innocent" onstage persona. In fact, they craved it. Her life story was also a source of optimism for many during bleak times. She had truly earned her way to stardom, rather than being born into it. And unlike more graceful, natural performers, she had to work hard when she was onstage. They loved that about her. But while Keeler was a huge star during the '30s, as the decade wound down, so did her career. Her marriage to Al Jolson came unraveled, and in 1940, she remarried outside Hollywood to a wealthy real estate broker and retired from showbiz — for what she thought would be forever. Thirty years later, the nation had survived World War II, a baby boom, television, Elvis, the civil rights movement, a presidential assassination, the Beatles, anti-war demonstrations, hippies, and astronauts walking on the moon. Basically, there were a lot of reasons to forget about Ruby Keeler. But she had come back, this time as a 61-year-old grandmother, performing in No, No, Nanette — a creaky old '20s musical that centers on a young flapper. The Broadway producer told her that if she agreed to do the play, she'd only have to do two musical numbers. From the very first preview in Boston, the audience greeted Keeler like an old friend, as she told an interviewer on opening night. What the people in the audience hadn't imagined was what it would do to them: Seeing her was like a fountain of youth. Especially when they realized she'd put on her tap shoes. A New York Times critic described the audience response to Keeler as "part nostalgia, part astonishment" at this model of "sobriety" hoofing with chorus boys half her age who were wearing sweaters so bright and zigzaggy, they looked like "a trainload of tigers struck by lightning." Madness was all around her, said the critic, but there was no madness to the diligent, dutiful kid who'd gone out there a youngster and was coming back a star. Comebacks are usually about reinvention, but not this one. Keeler still couldn't act or sing. But she worked hard up there onstage, just as she had on-screen, and when audiences saw her, they remembered the determined Depression-era youngster, and their own determined Depression-era youth. Outside the theater were things like Vietnam, psychedelia, all manner of the new. But up onstage, Keeler was as she'd always been. Eight shows a week through two years on Broadway and another two on the road. Working hard to make people happy, and fueling a nostalgia craze — one that would permeate 1970s entertainment much as the counterculture had the 1960s. [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
203022442	The mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac got hit so hard by the housing crisis that they required a massive federal rescue. Now lawmakers are looking to scale back the two entities' role — and the government's — in the mortgage market. The Senate Banking Committee is expected to vote Thursday on President Obama's nominee to head the agency that oversees Fannie and Freddie. The government took them over during the worst of the housing crisis, at a cost to taxpayers of nearly $200 billion. Now that the housing market is recovering, the companies have turned profitable, and they are sending money back to the Treasury. But many lawmakers remain worried about the government's outsize role in the mortgage market, and they're looking to make a change. Before Fannie and Freddie were taken over by the government in 2008, they operated in a kind of legal limbo. They were for-profit companies, helping to funnel money into the housing market. But they had an implicit guarantee that if they got into trouble, the government would bail them out. Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker says that has always been a problem. He says "almost everybody would say" that it's not appropriate to have "private gain and public losses." "This implicit guarantee is incredibly inappropriate," he says. New Approaches Corker, a Republican, and Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia have crafted a plan to gradually do away with Fannie and Freddie, while handing one of their functions over to a new government agency. That agency would guarantee mortgage-backed securities, to keep money flowing into the housing market. But unlike Fannie and Freddie, the new agency would collect a fee for the government's backing. The plan includes a number of other safeguards designed to protect taxpayers: Homebuyers would have to make a 5 percent down payment. And the companies issuing mortgage-backed securities would have to hold at least 10 percent capital in reserve. Corker says that's twice as much capital as Fannie and Freddie would have needed to weather the housing crisis without a government bailout. "If Fannie and Freddie had had 5 percent capital, there would have been no taxpayer contributions," he says. The Obama administration says it welcomes the bipartisan Senate approach. Meanwhile, House Republicans, led by Rep. Jeb Hensarling of Texas, have crafted an alternative bill. It would move the government even further out of the mortgage market, leaving only a limited role for the Federal Housing Administration to help first-time homebuyers and low-income families. But Warner told a gathering at the Bipartisan Policy Center on Wednesday that the House approach is a political nonstarter. He said Hensarling's bill is an "ideologically pure exercise which will never have a single Democrat ever support it." What Change Could Mean For Homebuyers Economist Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics says either bill would result in slightly higher interest rates on home loans. But Zandi says the increase would be bigger under the House Republicans' bill because the measure would lack a government guarantee. "More importantly for most Americans, there probably would be very few 30-year, fixed-rate loans out there — at least not for the typical homebuyer," Zandi says. "And the other thing to consider is that in really bad times, if the government really didn't step in, it would be pretty tough to get a mortgage loan for anybody at any time." House Republicans insist their bill would not end 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages. They note such loans are already available for high-priced homes that are too expensive to qualify for a government guarantee. But Zandi says the experience in other countries suggests that without a government backstop, long-term fixed-rate mortgages would not be widely available. He also says it's unrealistic to pretend the government would stay out of the mortgage market altogether. "The reality is that when push comes to shove, if things are really bad, the government will step in," he says. "So it's important that we all understand that, make that explicit, price for it to make sure that taxpayers don't pay for it in the future." These days, it's Fannie and Freddie who are paying taxpayers. The companies have returned $131 billion in dividends to the Treasury so far. Corker argues that's one more reason the government should move quickly to wind down the mortgage giants — before lawmakers become too attached to that money, and it becomes harder than ever to cut the cord.

203032386	The Beige Book is weird. It's an economic report released by the Federal Reserve every few months, but it doesn't have many numbers in it. Mostly, it's a bunch of stories gathered by talking to businesses around the country. A Fed economist once described it as the "Ask Your Uncle" approach to figuring out what's going on in the economy. In the Beige Book released today, for example, we learned that: Sales of pet supplies are "a bit soft" in the Western U.S. Sporting goods sales are strong in New England. Boat manufacturers and medical equipment firms in the St. Louis region are planning layoffs, but bakeries and firearms manufacturers are hiring. Also, as in the real world, everybody always talks about the weather in the Beige Book — especially when it rains. In today's Beige Book: Retailers told the Philly Fed that "excessive rain in June kept ... people away from stores, while some showed up just to 'hang out' at the mall." A "large department store chain" told the Richmond Fed that "cold and damp weather, along with the payroll tax change, had constrained sales." A "contact in South Carolina noted that heavy rains had damaged the regional wheat crop to the extent that sprouts were unacceptable for export." The Beige Book does try to pull all this stuff together. At the top of the report, there's a bit of synthesis of how different sectors are doing. ("Manufacturing expanded in most Districts since the previous report, with many Districts reporting increases in new orders, shipments, or production.") Still, much of the value in the Beige Book lies in all the weird, anecdotal details. Richard Fisher, president of the Dallas Fed, told us that beer sales at convenience stores, combined with reports from beer distributors, were one early sign of a slowdown in the homebuilding market before the crash. In other words, collecting anecdotes — asking your uncle — really can be useful. "My uncles and aunts were very helpful in helping me learn some basic lessons in life," Fisher said.

203032346	One day after his two years in limbo ended and he was confirmed by the Senate as head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Richard Cordray told NPR that though political bickering held up his nomination he now believes he has bipartisan support for the bureau's work. "It was a bipartisan vote to confirm me as director — 66 to 34 — and I like to think that reflects the fact that people recognize the work we're doing benefits constituents in every state," Cordray told All Things Considered host Audie Cornish. Before Cordray could get confirmed, of course, there had to be a "showdown" over filibuster rules that had held up his nomination and those of some others — capped by an extraordinary behind-closed-doors meeting of nearly all 100 senators. And a deal had to be struck that saw President Obama withdraw two nominees for posts on the National Labor Relations Board in order to get Republicans to agree to votes on the nominations of Cordray and a few others. With all that now behind, Cordray said his bureau is going to focus on exposing "deceptive and misleading marketing" schemes, "debt traps" that such consumers in over their heads financially and on educating consumers so that they aren't "just lambs to slaughter" when it comes to dealing with those looking to manage their investments. "We're here to stay," he said of the bureau, which was created over the opposition of many Republicans. We'll add the as-aired interview with Cordray to the top of this post later.

203014694	The Proceedings of the Royal Society politely refers to it as a "short-snouted horned dinosaur." National Geographic is less reserved and gets right to the obvious point: "Paleontologists have discovered a new dinosaur, a Triceratops relative with a supersize schnoz that once roamed present-day Utah." The Natural History Museum of Utah said Wednesday of the discovery made by a University of Utah graduate student in 2006 that: "Nasutoceratops titusi possesses several unique features, including an oversized nose relative to other members of the family, and exceptionally long, curving, forward-oriented horns over the eyes. The bony frill, rather than possessing elaborate ornamentations such as hooks or spikes, is relatively unadorned, with a simple, scalloped margin. "Nasutoceratops translates as 'big-nose horned face,' and the second part of the name honors Alan Titus, Monument Paleontologist at Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, for his years of research collaboration." As for that schnoz, the museum adds that: "For reasons that have remained obscure, all ceratopsids have greatly enlarged nose regions at the front of the face. Nasutoceratops stands out from its relatives, however, in taking this nose expansion to an even greater extreme. Scott Sampson, the study's lead author, stated, 'The jumbo-sized schnoz of Nasutoceratops likely had nothing to do with a heightened sense of smell — since olfactory receptors occur further back in the head, adjacent to the brain — and the function of this bizarre feature remains uncertain.' " The scientists estimate that Nasutoceratops weighed about 2 1/2 tons and stretched about 15 feet. According to National Geographic, it "munched on plants in a swampy, Louisiana-like bayou." All Things Considered is due to have more about Nasutoceratops later today. We'll add the audio of its report to the top of this post when it's ready. Update at 4:30 p.m. ET. "A Face Only A Mother Could Love." This dinosaur "looks like a giant bull with a parrot beak. It has a face that only a mother could love," Gregory Erickson, a paleobiologist at Florida State University, tells NPR's Rhitu Chatterjee during her report on All Things Considered.

202725167	At Philz Coffee in Palo Alto, Calif., a kid who looks like he should still be in high school is sitting across from me. He's wearing Google Glass. As I stare into the device's cyborg eye, I'm waiting for its tiny screen to light up. Then, I wait for a signal that Google Glass has recognized my face. It isn't supposed to do that, but Stephen Balaban has hacked it. "Essentially what I am building is an alternative operating system that runs on Glass but is not controlled by Google," he said. Balaban wants to make it possible to do all sorts of things with Glass that Google's designers didn't have in mind. One of the biggest fears about Google Glass is that the proliferation of these head-mounted computers equipped with intelligent cameras will fundamentally erode our privacy. Google has tried to respond to these fears by designing Glass so it is obvious to the people around these devices when and how they are being used. For example, to take a picture with Google Glass, you need to issue a voice command or tap your temple before the screen lights up. But hackers are proving it's possible to re-engineer Google Glass in any number of creative ways. And in the process, they've put Google in an awkward position. The company needs to embrace their creative talents if it hopes to build a software ecosystem around its new device that might one day attract millions of consumers. But at the same time, Google wants to try to rein in uses for Glass that could creep out the public or spook politicians who are already asking pointed questions about privacy. So when Balaban first announced he had built an app that let folks use Glass for facial recognition, Google reacted harshly. "I'd be lying if I said I was surprised," he said. The company said it wouldn't support programs on Glass that made facial recognition possible — and changed its terms of service to ban them. But that hasn't stopped techies like Balaban from building these services anyway. And now, there are all sorts of things developers are doing with Glass that were not built into the original design. Michael DiGiovanni created Winky — a program that lets someone wearing Google Glass take a photo with a wink of an eye. Marc Rogers, a principal security researcher at Lookout, realized he could hijack Glass if you could trick someone into taking a picture of a malicious QR code — a kind of square-shaped bar code that can send a computer directly to a website. But today, Rogers has nothing but praise for how Google responded to his hack. He says less than two weeks after he disclosed the problem to Google, the company had fixed it. "The other thing that is really good is the way they pushed Google Glass out to a community of people who are particularly good at finding vulnerabilities and improving software and fixing software — way before it is a consumer product," Rogers said. "This means that all of these vulnerabilities — or at least most of them — are going to be found long before Google Glass ever hits the market." Google's decision to give the first few thousand pairs of Google Glass to tinkerers and hackers and geeks was intentional. "In a case where you have [a product] that is so different from what is on the market currently, you really have to do these living laboratories where you figure out what the social and technical issues are before you release it more widely," said Thad Starner, a professor of computer science at Georgia Tech and a manager at Google Glass. When Google released Glass to the public, it didn't sell it to just anyone. The first few thousand people who got a pair were developers, a technically sophisticated group whose first impulse was to take it apart, peer inside its code and understand how it works. These people are hackers at heart, and when they got their hands on Google Glass, they broke it on purpose, cracking it open and exploring all the ways it could be used or possibly abused. "That's the great service our [Google Glass] explorers are doing for us," Starner said. "They are actually teaching us what these issues are and how we can address them." But some of the issues raised by Google Glass might not be possible to address with a simple technical fix. Ryan Calo, a law professor at the University of Washington who specializes in new technologies and privacy, has suggested that gadgets like Google Glass or civilian drones could act as "privacy catalysts" and spur conversations and legal debates about privacy in the digital age. Calo believes the conversations are long overdue. [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
202956379	(Click here to see an excerpt from the Rolling Stone story.) Even before it hit newsstands, Rolling Stone's latest cover caused controversy: It features a full-page photograph of alleged Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev sulking, his curly hair messily tossed in front of his eyes. As soon as Rolling Stone posted the cover on Facebook, it was inundated with negative comments: "I think it's wrong to make celebrities out of these people. Why give the guy the cover of Rolling Stone?" one Facebook user said, echoing thousands of others. The editor of the liberal Think Progress tweeted that the cover turned Tsarnaev "into Jim Morrison." Others opined that the cover wasn't offensive, just "uninspired." The controversy prompted CVS and the New-England based Tedeschi Food Shops to say they will not carry the magazine in their stores. (Click here to read our update about why Rolling Stone's managing editor stands by the magazine's decision.) Stefan Becket, who works for New York Magazine, seemed to be wondering what the big deal was because The New York Times used the same picture for a Sunday cover back in May. We have to admit that what also caught our attention was the accompanying blurb promoting the lengthy profile by contributing editor Janet Reitman. "How a Popular, Promising Student Was Failed by His Family, Fell Into Radical Islam and Became a Monster," it reads. That reminded us of a piece David J. Leonard, a professor specializing in race studies at Washington State University, wrote for Gawker following the Newtown shootings. Essentially, Leonard argued, white men are profiled as innocent by society, and when something goes wrong, something outside of them must be to blame. Leonard was reacting to the portrayal of Adam Lanza as a quiet and bright boy described as "nice" by some. Leonard wrote: "When I was pulled over in Emeryville, CA for speeding for several miles and asked multiple times by the police officer if there was a reason for my speeding, I told him the truth. 'Officer, my ice cream is melting.' "No stop and frisk. No pretext stop. No humiliating search. No fear of how to hold my hands. No ticket. I, like Adam Lanza and James Holmes, the two most notorious mass shooters of the past year, am white male privilege personified. We are humanized and given voice and innocence over and over again. ... "In fact, the media response to mass shootings often reimagines white men as victims. "The national spectacle and the hyper focus on Newtown and Aurora especially in comparison to the scant coverage afforded to murders in Chicago or drone deaths in South Waziristan points to the value of whiteness. School shootings and other mass killings matter when there are white victims. Whiteness is thus reimagined as under attack. White suburban kids, white suburban families, white suburban communities and even white shooters are the victims — victims of Hollywood, victims of gun laws that don't allow them to protect themselves in every context, victims of removal of prayer from public schools, and victims of soiling culture." To be fair, Rolling Stone's full story is not yet available as we publish this post. (Note at 5:30 p.m. ET: It's now online here.) But the framing of the story follows the pattern Leonard is talking about. It's a narrative reminiscent of one put forth by Time magazine's cover featuring Columbine shooters Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris. The headline asked: "The Monsters Next Door. What Made Them Do It?" We reached out to Leonard because we're guessing the Tsarnaev case puts wrinkles in his thinking. The Tsarnaev brothers, after all, represent an unlikely middle for America. They're white, but Muslim. We'll update this post once we hear back from Leonard on that point. Meanwhile we ask you: Is the Rolling Stone cover ill-conceived? What do you think about the framing? Update at 5:30 p.m. ET. The "Good Kid" Who Became "A Monster" Premise Of The Story: Now that it's posted online, you can see what Rolling Stone is writing. This passage seems to sum up much of what managing editor Will Dana said earlier about the piece: " 'Listen, [says Peter Payack, Tsarnaev's wrestling coach in high school] there are kids we don't catch who just fall through the cracks, but this guy was seamless, like a billiard ball. No cracks at all.' "And yet a deeply fractured boy lay under that facade; a witness to all of his family's attempts at a better life as well as to their deep bitterness when those efforts failed and their dreams proved unattainable. As each small disappointment wore on his family, ultimately ripping them apart, it also furthered Jahar's own disintegration — a series of quiet yet powerful body punches. No one saw a thing. 'I knew this kid, and he was a good kid,' Payack says, sadly. 'And, apparently, he's also a monster.' " Update at 3:40 p.m. ET. It Was An "Apt Image" For An Important Story, Rolling Stone Managing Editor Says: Saying that the cover photo is an "apt image because part of what the story is about is what an incredibly normal kid [Tsarnaev] seemed like to those who knew him best back in Cambridge [Mass.]," Rolling Stone managing editor Will Dana talked with All Things Considered host Melissa Block this afternoon. "I am completely comfortable about the decision that we made," he said of the cover photo. Dana sees the story Rolling Stone told as one of how a "seemingly normal, well-adjusted guy who appeared to be on a path — if not to achievement — at least to success" turned into "a monster" instead. And he believes that "if people read the story they'll see that there's nothing in here that's trying to build him [Tsarnaev] up as a hero." We'll add the as-broadcast version of the interview with Dana to the top of this post later today. Return to the top of this post Update at 2:16 p.m. ET. Maybe Americans See Tsarnaev Differently:  Professor Leonard emailed us with these thoughts: "Beyond the fact that I don't think the cover 'glorifies' Tsarnaev or portrays him as a rock star, I think the controversy focuses on the wrong issue. ... [The question should be] why is there an effort to explain how a 'promising student was failed by his family, fell into radical Islam and became a monster.' Or better said, how a suburban white [boy] (from the Caucus region) came to commit such heinous crimes. The picture and the headline operates through this vision that he was good, he was the boy next door, and that something changed him. The picture in this regard (as it was a picture from before the bombing) harkens his past, what he was like before his turn toward evil. It fits the common narrative afforded to the suburban, white male domestic terrorists. "At the same time, I wonder how much outrage the Columbine cover you referenced or the covers picturing Adam Lanza or [alleged Aurora, Colo. shooter] James Holmes elicited in terms of 'glorification' and turning 'killers into celebrities.' The fact that the images of these individuals did not prompt outrage reflects a willingness to see a level of innocence and how race, class, and religion all plays out here. This shows how many readers don't see Tsarnaev as white; he is different in their imagination from Lanza, Holmes, Kleebold and others." Return to the top of this post [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
202349035	This is the kind of opportunity most classical musicians can only dream about: to be invited to spend part of the summer with an orchestra touring the world — Washington, Moscow, St. Petersburg and London — with two of the biggest names in classical music, conductor Valery Gergiev and violinist Joshua Bell. You'll learn a ton, make lots of new friends, have the experience of a lifetime and earn boasting points for many years to come. But this chance is only available to you if you've managed to prove to a panel of judges that you're really among the best of the best — and if you happen to be between the ages of 16 and 19. That's the basis of the new National Youth Orchestra of the United States of America, an ensemble created and sponsored by Carnegie Hall. It's making its inaugural tour and has opened in a big way. After their debut on their "camp" grounds of Purchase College in New York Friday, the NYO-USA went on to play at the Kennedy Center in Washington. Tuesday, they performed at the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory in Russia. Thursday, they'll give a concert at the new Mariinsky II hall in St. Petersburg — as only the second international ensemble to give a concert there, after the London Symphony Orchestra. They're wrapping things up in London Sunday with a sold-out Proms concert at Royal Albert Hall. It's pretty heady and inspiring stuff, including a program that opens with a work written especially for the new ensemble, Magiya (Magic), by composer and Nevada native Sean Shepherd. Bell is the soloist in the Tchaikovsky concerto and Gergiev leads Shostakovich's blockbuster Tenth Symphony. Since Carnegie Hall first announced the program, executive and artistic director Sir Clive Gillinson has been fond of comparing the NYO-USA initiative to the Olympics. But, as he pointed out in his introductory remarks to the ensemble's first concert, there are 120 players in the NYO-USA, and they're all aged between 16 and 19 years old — which, by his reckoning, makes the orchestra even more competitive than Team USA for the 2012 Olympics, which boasted 530 athletes ranging in age from 15 to 54. Young musicians from 42 states were admitted to the orchestra. The 120 teens come from hometowns as far afield as Honolulu, Hawaii, Hattiesburg, Miss. and Eagle River, Alaska. Their ranks include a neutrino physics researcher, a pheasant hunter, a member of the National Slavic Honor Society, an 18-year-old college graduate, a sheep farmer and a Highland dancer. (If you're feeling a little less-than-snuff in such company, be assured that there were plenty of them who listed "watching movies" as one of their main hobbies.) As our friend Anne Midgette pointed out in her Washington Post feature about these players a few days ago, America's teenagers are not exactly going wanting for great youth orchestras. Every major metropolitan area seems to boast exemplary groups, and the summer festival possibilities are astounding for super-talented players. But this National Youth Orchestra of the USA has set out to be more than that. At the private reception that followed their debut performance, Gergiev said he believed that the new orchestra had the potential to improve Russian-American relations more than any traditional means of diplomacy. (Coming from a highly influential artist who is deeply involved in Russian politics — and in the midst of the Edward Snowden affair that is straining those bi-national ties — it was hard not to read some measure of meaning into those comments.) Carnegie's name, as Gillinson observed at the first concert's reception, certainly opens some very big and heavy doors. Gergiev doesn't take other U.S.-based youth orchestras on tour. The Mariinsky doesn't invite other young American players en masse to their hall, and American youth orchestras definitely do not get the chance to play at the Proms in London and have their performance broadcast live on BBC Radio 3, or televised on BBC Four. None of those things would happen without Carnegie's financial backing or their imprimatur. There's also the matter of finances. Training at a summer festival is an extremely expensive proposition, even though many offer extensive financial aid and scholarship opportunities. NYO-USA is entirely tuition-free and based on merit. Gillinson and his team certainly leaned on Carnegie Hall's name and reputation to help round up the financing for this initiative. But the NYO-USA also allows Carnegie Hall certain inroads at home and abroad. Carnegie Hall doesn't exactly need to launch a brand recognition campaign, but associating a youth orchestra with its hallowed reputation helps achieve two important long-term goals. First, it helps extend the Carnegie Hall brand (to use an odious marketing term) to international — and hopefully both young and international — audiences. Unlike other arts organizations, Carnegie doesn't have a "house band" to act as its ambassadors. The Philadelphia Orchestra can go to China (and pick up a ton of viral chatter on the way) to win new fans; the New York Philharmonic went to North Korea, with the encouragement of the State Department, as a gesture of political goodwill. As a venue that doesn't have any artists of its own, Carnegie Hall simply doesn't have that capability. The NYO-USA also allows young American classical players a way to experience the magic of being associated with Carnegie Hall, even — and maybe even especially if — they don't become professional musicians. (As Gillinson noted to Midgette, his guess would be that anywhere from 30 to 50 percent of these participants will go on to other careers; that sounds like an entirely reasonable estimate to me.) In fact, one could say that NYO-USA might even tilt towards players on other career tracks: One of the stipulations of eligibility is that applicants can't be full-time conservatory students. And whether they come from Maine, Florida or South Dakota, these musicians, and by natural extension their families and communities, are now wrapped up in that Carnegie magic. By June 5 of last month, there were more than 100 articles published in local papers and websites across the country about members of the first NYO-USA roster. That's dozens of different media outlets that most likely wouldn't otherwise have reason to cover anything going on at Carnegie Hall — or probably consider much (if any) classical music at all, for that matter. That's not to say that the NYO-USA was launched with a cold or overly calculating eye. Gillinson often speaks extremely warmly about his own experiences in the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain in the 1960s, and how much it shaped the rest of his life. If the NYO-USA can become that kind of force in America and give young musicians an enormously positive goal, then it's all to the good. In the meantime, Carnegie Hall is getting ready to start receiving applications for the 2014 round (in which David Robertson and Gil Shaham will tour with the orchestra across the United States). In 2015 the ensemble heads to China. [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
202959334	This weekend, one of our listeners spent their "cognitive surplus" producing a video (the one you're probably already watching). It remixes audio of Carl Kasell reading LOLcats captions on TED Radio Hour with the corresponding feline images. Here's the back story: In a new episode, TED Radio Hour explored the idea of collaboration. The kind of collaboration that has led to game-changing advancements like Wikipedia and CAPTCHAs, which capitalize on internet-security puzzles to digitize books and teach foreign languages for free. In his TED Talk, Clay Shirky, a leader in studying the effects of new technologies, explains how small moments of free time for individuals around the world - "cognitive surplus" he calls it - have made way for these mass collaborations that are changing the world. He told TED Radio Hour Host Guy Raz that people in the United States have an average 30-35 hours of free time a week, and people, especially the younger generation, are not just watching television. Prime example: LOLcats. Raz called in Kasell, Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me's official judge and scorekeeper, to explain the viral memes on the show. And, well, you are watching the results. Meow.

203004248	Part I of the news from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday was Chairman Ben Bernanke's signal to the financial markets that the central bank won't be shifting away from its "easy money" policy just yet. Part II was just released. In its latest "Beige Book" review of economic conditions around the nation the Fed says that: "Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicate that overall economic activity continued to increase at a modest to moderate pace." In other words, the economy continues to chug along much as it has for the last few years. As Bloomberg News notes: "The previous Beige Book, released June 5, used the same phrase as today's report, a 'modest to moderate pace,' to describe growth across 11 of 12 districts." Among the evidence of continued growth cited in the latest Beige Book: "Manufacturing expanded in most Districts since the previous report, with many Districts reporting increases in new orders, shipments, or production. Most Districts noted that overall consumer spending and auto sales increased during the reporting period. ... Hiring held steady or increased at a measured pace in most Districts, with some contacts noting reluctance to hire permanent or full-time workers."  [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
202962326	In this installment of Sense of Place: Rio, songwriter Sylvio Fraga performs two songs with his trio. There are underlying hints of samba in his performance, as well as a hefty dose of American songwriting. It makes sense that he would combine the two styles, given that he grew up in both Rio de Janeiro and New York City. Fraga recently released his debut album Rosto, which he's made available for free download on his website. [Copyright 2013 WXPN-FM] 
10550878	Forro in the Dark gets its name from the Forro, a type of dance and music that's been popular in northeastern Brazil for more than 100 years. The style's traditional incarnation involves a three-piece band with a triangle, an accordion and a bass-like drum called a zabumba. But Forro in the Dark doesn't conform to those limitations, instead taking the lively and emotional genre to new heights by drawing on influences ranging from Enrique Iglesias to Beck. The resulting music sounds optimistic and celebratory, occasionally instrumental and always compelling. The band was born when frontman Mauro Refosco threw a birthday party and invited a few friends to play with him; soon, Forro in the Dark began a tradition of sold-out weekly performances. Hear a few songs from this 2007 session, recorded shortly after the group's debut album, The Bonfires of Sao Joao, was released. This story was first published on May 30, 2007.

5041114	The music of Seu Jorge occupies a singular place in today's Brazil. His songs are widely hailed as a return to the traditional songwriting of Tom Jobim and Caetano Veloso. But his style, and his background, lead many to call Jorge a hero of life on Rio's streets. It was his history in the slums of Rio de Janeiro that led to bigger things for Jorge, including a high-profile appearance in the 2002 film City of God. In America, many listeners were first exposed to Jorge's music in The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou, the Wes Anderson film that featured Jorge as a guitar-playing member of a sea expedition crew. He appeared between narrative sequences, playing intimate versions of David Bowie classics. Jorge released Cru, a calmer follow-up to his album Carolina, in 2002. The songs on it mix ballads and bossa nova while helping cement Seu Jorge's place in the line of great Brazilian songwriters and performers. Hear a few recorded songs from Cru in this session for World Cafe. This story and session were first published on Dec. 6, 2005. [Copyright 2013 WXPN-FM] 
202999010	Nelson Mandela is making "remarkable progress" and could be released from a Pretoria hospital soon, his daughter tells Sky News on the eve of the anti-apartheid icon's 95th birthday. Zindzi Mandela, 52, also says her father is communicating with his eyes and hands, watching television and that "you can see he is there in his eyes; the same energy and strength." The elder Mandela, who spent 27 behind bars as a political prisoner during the long battle against South Africa's apartheid system, went on to become president in 1994 after his nation's first democratic elections. Mandela has been in a hospital since June 8 for treatment of a life-threatening respiratory infection. On Thursday, his birthday is being celebrated as Nelson Mandela Day in South Africa. Earlier on Wednesday, The Daily Telegraph reported that a granddaughter — Ndileka Mandela — says her grandfather's condition is "stable." It added that on Nelson Mandela Day his family will, "like many South Africans and people around the world ... spend 67 minutes undertaking charity work ... in recognition of the 67 years South Africa's first black, democratic president spent in public service."

202737139	Quinoa lovers have been put on a bit of a guilt trip with stories suggesting that the increased demand in the U.S. has put the superfood out of reach for those living closest to where it's grown. How can poor Bolivians in La Paz afford to pay three times more for quinoa than they would pay for rice, critics have asked? So some quinoa farmers in Bolivia and distributors are talking back. And what they want us to know is that their incomes are rising. As the price of quinoa has tripled since 2006, and farmers plant more of the crop, they're typically making more money. "To me, quinoa ... is absolutely changing the lives of our regional community of people," German Nina, a quinoa farmer, said during a conference call organized by Alter Eco Foods, which sells quinoa products that are fair trade certified. Eduoard Rollet of Alter Eco adds that when he visits the farmers that he buys from in Bolivia, he finds that they are typically setting aside a portion of the quinoa they grow so that they can eat it themselves throughout the year. "The farmers who have been eating quinoa traditionally are still eating quinoa," he told me. And since their incomes are up, "they're able to now afford [foods such as] tomatoes and salads and veggies, and foods that they weren't able to afford before," Rollet says. And he's not alone in thinking that the quinoa boom has been good, on balance, for rural communities in Bolivia. It is "very good news for small, indigenous farmers," says Pablo Laguna, an anthropologist who has studied quinoa's influence on local communities in Bolivia. Quinoa's popularity, he says, is bringing more income to the southern highlands, traditionally one of the poorest regions in Bolivia. Laguna has also worked as a consultant to Alter Eco. Laguna acknowledges that "quinoa prices are definitely higher" for locals. But among the rural and farm families of southwest Bolivia, "households have not diminished ... their quinoa consumption," he says. In some instances, Laguna says, llama herders in the regions are eating a bit less quinoa because of the price, but they're still eating more than most other households in the world. He says that these families recognize and appreciate quinoa's nutritional value. Nutritionally, it's a superstar, since it contains an ideal blend of essential amino acids that form a complete protein. And quinoa has become a vegan-foodie favorite, known for its nutty taste and satisfying texture. So if quinoa farmers are still enjoying this crop, what is the downside of the boom? Some would point to the cities of Bolivia and Peru. I've already mentioned that quinoa is three times more expensive than rice in La Paz markets. And according to an article in The Guardian, quinoa is more expensive than chicken in markets in Lima. These prices do likely put quinoa out of reach for poorer people. But Laguna notes that while quinoa has been a staple for rural Bolivians, it isn't one for city folks. Bolivian President Evo Morales has weighed in on the issue as well. Though some press reports from 2011 suggested domestic consumption was down, Morales says otherwise. "It's not true that due to an increase in the price of quinoa, less and less is being consumed" in Bolivia, The Associated Press quoted Morales as saying in an article in February. In fact, Morales pointed to a threefold increase in domestic consumption of quinoa over the past four years.

202941301	If you want people to slim down, why not reward them with gold? That's the tack being taken in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Alarmed at ballooning waistlines in a region where fast food is common and comfortable outdoor exercise is not, the local government is offering to give citizens a gram of gold for each kilogram lost by Aug. 16, according to news reports. That's about $41 for a little over two pounds of pudge, based on today's market rate. Participants have to lose at least two kilos to get the golden payout. They have to show up by Friday to weigh in, according to the Associated Press. And health care providers are expected to be on hand to recommend healthful weight-loss methods. In the United States, rewards for people who lose weight, stop smoking and otherwise shape up are becoming part of workplace wellness programs, though they have yet to include precious metals in the payoff, as far as we know. A 2011 survey of large U.S. employers found that half were using incentives as part of wellness programs, or planned to do so. They typically reduce the cost of health insurance premiums for employees who participate. But those kind of systems can lead to discrimination against people who are in poor health through no fault of their own, patient advocates say. Plus, incentives don't always work. Studies in which people were paid to stop smoking or lose weight have been a mixed bag. Still, some employers say they've seen sustained benefits in lower health care costs. Washington's King County saved $6 million in health care costs between 2007 and 2011, in part by offering incentives for county employees to lose weight, according to NPR's Yuki Noguchi. But for some people, the stick works better than the carrot. Programs like StickK let people pledge to pay money to a cause they loathe if they fail to meet a weight-loss goal. [Copyright 2013 NPR] 
202980701	Asiana Airlines has decided not sue the San Francisco television station that aired the bogus names of the flight crew piloting Flight 214, a Boeing 777 that crash-landed at San Francisco International Airport earlier this month. As we reported on Monday, the airline said it would sue the station because it damaged its reputation by inadvertently airing offensive names. CNN reports: "The company said Wednesday it wouldn't file a suit after KTVU offered an official apology. The bogus names, which phonetically spelled out phrases such as "Something Wrong" and "We Too Low," were read during KTVU's noon broadcast Friday. The airline called the report 'demeaning' and said it was 'reviewing possible legal action.'" In related news, the AP reports that a Chicago law firm said it is suing Boeing on behalf of 83 people who were on the flight. The AP reports the suit alleges a malfunctioning auto-throttle may have caused the crash. The AP adds: "Ribbeck Law Chartered on Monday filed a petition for discovery, which is meant to preserve evidence, in Cook County Circuit Court in Chicago, where the aircraft manufacturer is headquartered. The firm said in a news release that additional pleadings will be filed against Asiana Airlines and several component parts manufacturers in coming days. "In addition to potential problems with the Boeing 777's auto throttle, some emergency slides reportedly opened inside the plane, injuring passengers and blocking their exit, and some passengers had to be cut out of their seatbelts with a knife, the firm contends."

203038470	A study released last week by Boston-based Strategy Analytics has revealed that, in general, Americans really don&#8217;t want their TVs watching them. The research found that &#8220;43 percent of people would never allow a camera or sensing device to be connected to their TV.&#8221; On the other hand, 14 percent said they&#8217;re okay with their TV viewing their behavior and their data being collected. Verizon already applied for a patent for a DVR system that would be able to track movement in a room and tailor its advertisements based on what it learns. For example, if it detects a dog in the room, it could run advertisements for dog food. The patent was denied because similar technology already exists. Legislation to control this kind of technology is also in the works. Congressman Mike Capuano, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Congressman Walter Jones, Republican of North Carolina, have proposed new legislation would require companies to explicitly ask consumers for permission to collect and store their data.

203038373	Today the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced that federal student loan debt now tops a trillion dollars. Many people across the country are trying to figure out a solution to that problem. One proposal from Oregon has been attracting a lot of attention. It&#8217;s called &#8220;Pay It Forward,&#8221; and it would allow students to learn now and pay later based on a percentage of their future income. The idea grew out of a seminar class at Portland State University. &#8220;It would work like social security in reverse,&#8221; one of the seminar students, Tracy Gibbs, told Here & Now. &#8220;You would get the benefit of your education now and pay 3 percent of your gross adjusted income once you graduate, for a number of years.&#8221; Michael Dembrow is a state representative for Oregon, and also chair of the higher education committee. He&#8217;s also an English professor at Portland Community College. He helped to shepherd the legislation though the state legislature. &#8220;We&#8217;ve really seen the issue of student debt come to a tipping point,&#8221; he said.
