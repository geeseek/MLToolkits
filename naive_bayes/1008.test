203038353	For the first time since the big housing crash five years ago, it appears that some lawmakers are getting serious about replacing the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Fannie and Freddie back most of the mortgages in the country. Now, two prominent senators &#8212; one a Democrat and one a Republican &#8212; have a proposal to phase them out. NPR&#8217;s Chris Arnold explains what this could mean for the future of the housing finance system. GuestChris Arnold, correspondent for NPR. He tweets @Chris_ArnoldNPR. [Copyright 2013 WBUR-FM] 
203038338	In the central Mexican state of Hidalgo, in a park called EcoAlberto, there’s a recreational attraction that offers visitors hot springs, rappelling and more recently, the thrills and chills of an illegal border crossing. The real border is nearly 800 miles away, but this simulated crossing run by the indigenous HñaHñu community takes visitors through a fake U.S.-Mexico crossing, complete with smugglers and the threat of border patrol agents.

203047251	Down syndrome affects nearly six million people worldwide. The genetic disorder impairs physical growth and intelligence, and it can cause serious medical problems, from heart defects to early dementia. Down syndrome is caused by a chromosome defect and today, the journal Nature reports that researchers may have found a way to correct that defect, though it will be years before it could be used as a therapy in humans. It&#8217;s an application of the idea behind gene therapy. The premise is that if you have a disease that’s caused by a defect in a single gene, a virus engineered to carry a “fix-it” gene can be sent in to remove and replace the abnormal gene. The new application of this idea is called chromosome therapy. Down syndrome is caused by the presence of a third copy of chromosome number 21. Chromosome therapy could be used to &#8220;silence&#8221; or turn off the extra copy, which contains hundreds of genes, with the hope that that would turn off the effects of Down Syndrome.

203038242	Three months after a deadly explosion at a fertilizer plant in West, Texas, killed 15 people and injured at least 200 others, Mayor Tommy Muska says residents there are trying to move on and rebuild. One of the main tasks has been demolishing destroyed home to make room for new ones. “We’ve had about 117 demolitions in the last three months,” Muska said. After three months, the effects of the explosion show in the town’s psyche, Muska said, and providing mental health services is a priority. Students from Baylor University have been offering counseling to residents, and Muska says people often come into his office needing to vent. “They just need someone to talk to sometimes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I’ve been a cheerleader for the past three months. It took seconds for it to be destroyed, and it’s going to take a long time to get it rebuilt.&#8221; GuestTommy Muska, mayor of West, Texas. [Copyright 2013 WBUR-FM] 
203030483	The Yemen-based branch of al-Qaida says a U.S. drone strike has killed a former Guantanamo Bay prisoner who rose to become the group&#8217;s No. 2 figure. The announcement, posted on militant websites, gives no date for the death of Saudi-born Saeed al-Shihri. In January, Yemen&#8217;s official SABA news agency had reported that al-Shihri died of wounds from a drone strike three months earlier. The monitoring group SITE said today that al-Shihri was eulogized in the video by a senior official in the terrorist group, known as Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. Al-Shihri fought in Afghanistan and spent six years in Guantanamo. He was returned to Saudi Arabia in late 2007 and later fled to Yemen to join the al-Qaida branch there.
